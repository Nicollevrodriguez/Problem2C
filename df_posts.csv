My personal take is that Millennials lived through 9/11 and were old enough to understand what it was like before that, and what changed afterwards (anti-war sentiment before and after Afghanistan and Iraq, laws like the PATRIOT act being passed as a consequence, fear, etc.).  Generation Z were born after this, or were too young to understand.

Another way of thinking about it is that while both generations are Internet-savvy, Millennials are more likely to remember things like dial-up, Geocities, MSN and MySpace.  They're thus more likely to understand how the Internet began and thus perhaps be a bit more cautious about things like social media privacy.  Generation Z, on the other hand, grew up with Facebook as ubiquitous as email was to Millennials, and thus their lower-bounds on privacy are...  Facebook.

21 is right on the boundary, possibly too young to understand 9/11 in the same way as an older Millennial would.

As a last resort, you could offer her £20 a month extra to have the heating set at your desired times/temperature. Of course only do this after seeing the actual cost incurred to her. Something like that, if it’s worth it to you.

Be firm and remind her that you’re paying for rent with bills included, but at the moment you’re so cold that you cannot sleep and are getting ill. You could also get a thermometer and show her how cold it is in your room at night. If you start providing details, numbers and photos, she’ll start to get intimidated by your documentation.

431,"Also suggest this. I have a couple of rooms I let out. I’d much prefer to supply a heater for one out of two people who is chilly/gets up earlier/goes to bed earlier than heat the whole house. 

I get she doesn’t want to put the heating on at night for the same temperature as day time hours, but most systems allow it to stay on at a lower temperature so it just kicks in if it drops below a certain level, though this might not work if you’re in a much colder room and the thermostat is somewhere warmer in the house. 

It would be massively unreasonable for the landlady to say no to that, or that you can’t have a top up heater. If it were me as the house owner I’d prefer the extra heater option but would source it myself. That way I could choose the most energy efficient one.

It wasn’t a cheap price but she seemed to refuse that any significant portion of my rent would have to be spent on reasonable heating and electricity use. (Edit) I was in a tiny studio flat and her side was a four bedroom house with massive lounge, kitchen, dining room and conservatory.

It's not common to have the heating on at night but the two hours a day you're getting is surely not enough either.

Have you tried bleeding the radiator? Could you get someone in to look at it?

I wouldn't recommend any electric heater unless you want to be arguing about it and being asked to leave. Some of them also present a bit of a hazard.

Definitely get an electric blanket. I recommend overblankets rather than ones that go under your bottom sheet. They're fantastic. You can also drape them over yourself when you're sitting at your desk or on your sofa or whatever you have.

Could you speak to your landlady about maybe paying a bit more to have a bit more heating? It's obviously not fair on you but it's a kind of question of survival.

Otherwise, is it worth staying there or are you better off looking for somewhere else?

The 'uneconomical' comes from trying to maintain temperature with poor insulation. 

If you can't modify the structure of your house to be better insulated (although, sometimes that is an option - there's usually places where insulation can be added) then curtains and drapes help. Windows and doorways are usually the biggest heat sinks, so curtaining over them does a lot. And after that, drapes on your walls will trap air and reduce heat losses.

527,"I was talking about the contract situation in general, as this is what a lot of people are confused by - if your contract says you have a ""license"" or any of bizarre wording that employs terms that don't really have a strict, legal definition, but your landlord does not live with you, you're a tenant, end of.

Obviously it's a different ballgame if you don't have the time/money to fight it out (sadly, a lot of people don't - which is another thing landlords exploit, and often), but in pure theory, if your landlord doesn't live with you, you can claw yourself in in case of problems, take the whole thing to court and you **will** win - and there are numerous stories of people having done so, having won 3x deposit if it wasn't put in protection scheme, etc. etc.

In OP's case, if they only can, I'd just look at moving out as the price doesn't seem to correspond to the quality of living, it's not market value especially as a lodger, as the first move. For that kind of money I feel they could still be a tenant somewhere, and have less headache, and improved conditions, too - maybe in a less desirable/central part of London if they're in one of the in-demand parts now, but it still should be doable.

Second move, if they can't move out that is, would be getting an electric heater, yes, although it _is_ risky because with a live-in landlord they are a lodger and the landlord does have a legal right to come in and peek around whether when the lodger is in or not, or use any silly pretext they can come up with - and I bet they won't like seeing electric heaters they haven't been told about, as, by the sound of it, they're quite thrifty and tight-fisted as it is.

Sadly, as a live-in landlord they _can_ do that and kick the OP out at no notice then, and that's another thing that the courts would side with, in general - if you're lodging you should generally know what you're signing up for, and that's having little rights and no safety net. 

Lodging is generally a shit arrangement, probably the only benefit being it can be a bit cheaper than renting as a tenant (but not always, mind), and things like a broken boiler, electricity/gas issues etc. being sorted out rather promptly, because unless the house/flat is built in a very specific way with some kind of a separation of supply networks between their part and your part, all the problems will immediately hit the landlord as well - and they won't want to suffer themselves too much. I think we all know that maintenance repairs can take days, if not weeks, depending on the problem, with independent/private landlords or agencies.

With live-in landlords the vibe is really a lot about what kind of people they are, at the end of the day.

There _are_ those live-in landlords who treat their lodgers with respect, try to become friends with them, and treat them as tenants in all but name - but, sadly, a lot of them are the opposite. 

In OP's case someone who only switches the heating on for 2 hours in the evening in the middle of one of the coldest and harshest winters in recent memory, and doesn't have enough of consideration in them to realise it can be problematic for another person… Well, they're not one of those landlords, sadly, so you can't count on their common sense, good reasoning or sympathy.",2024-01-24 10:09:45,1,london,comment,Moved into a loft room for 3 months… live in landlady doesn’t put heating on very often,"['talking', 'contract', 'situation', 'general', 'lot', 'people', 'confused', 'contract', 'say', '``', 'license', ""''"", 'bizarre', 'wording', 'employ', 'term', ""n't"", 'really', 'strict', 'legal', 'definition', 'landlord', 'live', ""'re"", 'tenant', 'end', 'obviously', ""'s"", 'different', 'ballgame', ""n't"", 'time/money', 'fight', 'sadly', 'lot', 'people', ""n't"", 'another', 'thing', 'landlord', 'exploit', 'often', 'pure', 'theory', 'landlord', ""n't"", 'live', 'claw', 'case', 'problem', 'take', 'whole', 'thing', 'court', 'win', 'numerous', 'story', 'people', 'done', '3x', 'deposit', ""n't"", 'put', 'protection', 'scheme', 'etc', 'etc', 'op', ""'s"", 'case', ""'d"", 'look', 'moving', 'price', ""n't"", 'seem', 'correspond', 'quality', 'living', ""'s"", 'market', 'value', 'especially', 'lodger', 'first', 'move', 'kind', 'money', 'feel', 'could', 'still', 'tenant', 'somewhere', 'le', 'headache', 'improved', 'condition', 'maybe', 'le', 'desirable/central', 'part', 'london', ""'re"", 'one', 'in-demand', 'part', 'still', 'doable', 'second', 'move', 'ca', ""n't"", 'move', 'would', 'getting', 'electric', 'heater', 'yes', 'although', '_is_', 'risky', 'live-in', 'landlord', 'lodger', 'landlord', 'legal', 'right', 'come', 'peek', 'around', 'whether', 'lodger', 'use', 'silly', 'pretext', 'come', 'bet', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'seeing', 'electric', 'heater', ""n't"", 'told', 'sound', ""'re"", 'quite', 'thrifty', 'tight-fisted', 'sadly', 'live-in', 'landlord', '_can_', 'kick', 'op', 'notice', ""'s"", 'another', 'thing', 'court', 'would', 'side', 'general', ""'re"", 'lodging', 'generally', 'know', ""'re"", 'signing', ""'s"", 'little', 'right', 'safety', 'net', 'lodging', 'generally', 'shit', 'arrangement', 'probably', 'benefit', 'bit', 'cheaper', 'renting', 'tenant', 'always', 'mind', 'thing', 'like', 'broken', 'boiler', 'electricity/gas', 'issue', 'etc', 'sorted', 'rather', 'promptly', 'unless', 'house/flat', 'built', 'specific', 'way', 'kind', 'separation', 'supply', 'network', 'part', 'part', 'problem', 'immediately', 'hit', 'landlord', 'well', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'suffer', 'much', 'think', 'know', 'maintenance', 'repair', 'take', 'day', 'week', 'depending', 'problem', 'independent/private', 'landlord', 'agency', 'live-in', 'landlord', 'vibe', 'really', 'lot', 'kind', 'people', 'end', 'day', '_are_', 'live-in', 'landlord', 'treat', 'lodger', 'respect', 'try', 'become', 'friend', 'treat', 'tenant', 'name', 'sadly', 'lot', 'opposite', 'op', ""'s"", 'case', 'someone', 'switch', 'heating', '2', 'hour', 'evening', 'middle', 'one', 'coldest', 'harshest', 'winter', 'recent', 'memory', ""n't"", 'enough', 'consideration', 'realise', 'problematic', 'another', 'person…', 'well', ""'re"", 'one', 'landlord', 'sadly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'count', 'common', 'sense', 'good', 'reasoning', 'sympathy']",0.577981657119395,0.5026492952971574,0.5825184441345342

Contracts can say a lot of things, but it’s the actual situation and living arrangements that matter.

Similarly the flips side to it is, if your landlord _does not_ live with you, you’re a tenant - even though a lot of landlords try being clever and give people some “sublet” or “license agreements”, or whatever BS, that basically claims you’re a lodger, or a licensee, all meaning they have no obligations towards you and you have no rights, no notice periods, no right to have a deposit in the DPS you need to get the details of, etc etc. 

With all this, they’re only trying to exploit people’s lack of knowledge of the law.

536,"Really depends on the size of the space you're heating, how cold it is outside, how much insulation you have (loft rooms are usually not well insulated, I have loft bedrooms in two separate houses and they're always much colder in winter than the rest of the house).

I have a 3 bedroom Victorian House heated using exactly these types of heaters. Compared to gas central heating, the cost of running these things is, like I said, enormous.

It's not 15 minutes and done. It's an hour to bring a room up to temperature if it's not already warm, and then it'll turn itself on and off every 5 to 10 minutes to maintain the temperature, or in other terms it's on about 50% of the time to maintain temperature. So yes, to keep one room warm for just an evening you're looking at £2-£3. Now add the morning to that, and if you're at home it'll be on and off through the afternoon too. Now add the concept of having other rooms in your house and wanting them to be at least 16C rather than 8C, so add a couple quid for the dining room, another couple quid for the bathroom which absolutely must be maintained or you'll end up with a serious mould problem in no time. Then assuming you have no gas add to that the cost of heating water using electricity, too.

If you're lodging and have to just top up one room, sure, whatever, it doesn't seem like a lot.

645,"""The gradual, but persistent death of the London living room"". This isn't new at all, it's been that way for some time now.

When I first moved to London, I lived in a two-bedroom house, but the downstairs living room had been turned into a third bedroom. The landlord got the house with Right to Buy, so the house was supposed to have a family living in it, but he rented it out instead. I didn't pay by direct debit; I used to leave my money in cash in the microwave, and he'd come late at night to pick it up.

One day he found out that someone from the Right to Buy scheme was coming to check the house, so he needed to make it look like a family was living there. He turned up in the morning, rehung all of the doors so they didn't have locks on, moved all of the furniture out of the downstairs bedroom, put living room furniture in, and then at the end of the day after the inspection happened, returned everything to normal. 

So I guess you could say that we did have a living room for about six hours for one day when he thought his scam was going to be rumbled.",2020-04-23 09:06:58,633,london,comment,The sudden death of the London living room; “About half of all listings on SpareRoom in the capital have no lounge”,"['``', 'gradual', 'persistent', 'death', 'london', 'living', 'room', ""''"", ""n't"", 'new', ""'s"", 'way', 'time', 'first', 'moved', 'london', 'lived', 'two-bedroom', 'house', 'downstairs', 'living', 'room', 'turned', 'third', 'bedroom', 'landlord', 'got', 'house', 'right', 'buy', 'house', 'supposed', 'family', 'living', 'rented', 'instead', ""n't"", 'pay', 'direct', 'debit', 'used', 'leave', 'money', 'cash', 'microwave', ""'d"", 'come', 'late', 'night', 'pick', 'one', 'day', 'found', 'someone', 'right', 'buy', 'scheme', 'coming', 'check', 'house', 'needed', 'make', 'look', 'like', 'family', 'living', 'turned', 'morning', 'rehung', 'door', ""n't"", 'lock', 'moved', 'furniture', 'downstairs', 'bedroom', 'put', 'living', 'room', 'furniture', 'end', 'day', 'inspection', 'happened', 'returned', 'everything', 'normal', 'guess', 'could', 'say', 'living', 'room', 'six', 'hour', 'one', 'day', 'thought', 'scam', 'going', 'rumbled']",0.6300227215370645,0.49337270568260233,0.5994914977664298

653,"What's really frustrating is that, as someone who had similar experiences, when we moved out of the country for a few years we decided to be the BEST landlords ever and instead got absolutely SHAT on by money-grabbing lettings management companies. 

We let out place out for two years and when we got it back, had to literally gut it back to studs and joists it was so ruined,. We had completely renovated it for tenants. So upsetting. 

The management companies would get complaints from tenants and not pass them on or do anything about it. We would have been very happy to fix leaks and other issues but weren't told about them until it was too late. Our tenants were told we said no to fixes, which was never true, so they thought we were total pricks and didn't care about our property as a result. Such a stupid situation.

Lettings management companies are an enormous part of the problem in London renting. They get their fees from landlords AND the tenants upfront, and then don't have to actually manage the property adequately - as long as they're 'sorting it' on paper they can just keep putting off arranging contractors etc for anything indefinitely for anything that's not 'roof fallen in' levels of complaint. 

Even good landlords can be caught by that, we never wanted our tenants to have to live in a shitty leaky space but that ended up being out of our hands. We would never let a property again unless we could be there to look after the tenants ourselves.

Good landlords do exist, we just need to get rid of the crooked ones...which is not an easy task.

To make people more aware of the room price, it's condition, ongoing issues, area info, etc. We can't rate landlords yet, but we have to start from somewhere and this is just the beginning.

You could put it there, so we can grow the community and finally make a difference and change how tenants are being treated; starting from London.

If that means property owners return the living room into a living room instead of a bedroom then that's what will happen. 

You could try to cram 6 people into a 4 bed house, with one in the garage and one in the living room. Charging £500 a month for each room. Or you could fit 4 people into a 4 bed house with a living room, decent kitchen and garage to store bikes ect, and charge £750 per room. 

Same money, less liability, and less rooms you have to fill. It makes sense. 

The reason they don't do it now, it haven't done it in the past, is because demand for housing meant that they could stuff as many people as they could into a house and still charge £750 per room. But as demand falls, wages tumble, unemployment rises and migrants head home, hopefully people demand more from their landlords.

Arithmetic is largely underpinned by logic (though to what extent is a matter of some debate), and so the idea is that a lot of mathematical objects and operations can essentially be boiled right down into purely logical terms. Some philosophers (Frege) have tried to prove that maths is pretty much entirely reducable to logic, while others (Hilbert, Brouwer) have taken a more abstract, intuitive approach.

1004,"Yes, they treat housing like a commodity, not like an investment. Typically you live in it until you die and then a new person will replace the building with a new build.

The result is much more affordable housing, and you don't have a system of inheritance which push house prices up across generation after generation which cuts out even any chance of people in London to get a foothold on the ladder without having come from money.

A house being worth ""nothing"" 40 years later isn't entirely true. You are buying the land, and the house on it is effectively your personal property. Japanese culture makes it normal to want to live in a place that hasn't been lived in before. That's nothing to do with government migration policy and everything to do with societal norms and preferences. The value of the land is still dictated by its location.

It's the same as buying a parking space, and putting a car on it. The car depreciates in value, the land it's on doesn't, and you can choose how expensive the car you buy is.

In equivalence that means you can buy cheap second hand (e.g. live in the second hand house), or you can go right up to new luxury. It's not uncommon for a new luxury item today to be near worthless 15 years later (cars, Apple products etc.).

1079,"Speaking statistically, you only have yourselves to blame IMO. Or your parents for the young Zoomers among you.

I was calling this stuff out in 2010 when Cameron got in. I was typically downvoted on Reddit, told that I'm too partisan, too extreme, too *hateful* against Tories, the poor Tories.

I'm actually pretty moderate centre-left and always have been. I'm not into ""destroy capitalism"" or anything like that. But I could see very easily from 2010 that the Tory austerity was ideological, it was economically illiterate, and it was going to seriously downgrade our country. And I saw that their zealous deregulation and anti-welfare crusades was going to have huge ramifications, greatly subtract from people's sense of security, and would probably end up socially murdering tens of thousands of people through knock-on effects.

This was all pretty obvious at the time, if you didn't have a stick up your arse.

Corbyn got it right. How many of you were ""very sophisticated centrist liberals""  who undermined him? Many of you need to get real: you're not American capitalists, you're just white collar office workers in England. Your country, it turns out, had relied on the plank of post-war Labour's social welfarism. Without that we are nothing; we look almost feudal. It was sheer delusion to think that you didn't need Labour, and you didn't need to worry about regulation, public services and the welfare state, because you're *so very posh.*

Quit deluding yourselves. The international super-rich, and American investors in particular, will utterly eat you for breakfast, buy you and sell you.

1080,"Markets exist whether you like it or not. It's not an engineered thing.

Even in places where markets are outlawed, black markets and gray markets exist. 

A property with X amount of space in it, and X number of rooms is wanted by people. There is an amount of effort/sacrifice people will be willing to do to have that property. That translates to a market price. If you legislate against it, that demand doesn't go away, it just manifests in other ways - e.g. a waiting list that only the affluent can get on, or a black market system that trades slots through bribery, or something else.

And the solution doesn't have to be a free-market solution. If the government built a million homes outside the market, that would make homes way cheaper. If the government improve pubic transport massively, then people could live further away from the things that they want get to, and we'd have more space. If we deregulated some of the zoning in London, more homes could be built.

Nor does telling the landlord, because that's exactly what he'll do. He'll say ""Okay, fine, one of you is kicked out and one of these rooms is now a living room"". He has no incentive to lower the rent after doing so. The property is still the same size, and the demand for it is still the same. In fact, it's probably higher, because a huge percentage of the London population that was living without a living room has now gotten kicked out and is competing for the remaining properties.

1106,"Kitchens *are* optional. That's why you can get bedsits.

There are minimum regulations for what a home can be, and it's good that there are. But those do increase the prices of homes. It's necessarily related. 

If you could sell a death-trap legally, then it would be possible to buy that death trap home below the current market rates. Slums are slums, but they're also cheap.

It's good that we regulate against slums, without proper safety or various minimum requirements, because they have knock-on effects (e.g. lots of people dying in a fire).

But that does mean that things cost more. It's good, that people be forced to pay for fire-safe, healthy homes, because if they aren't forced to pay for that many people will buy unsafe homes and there will be a much larger future cost to that. People are very bad at judging future costs.

But is a living room something that's the minimum requirements? Outside space? Dining room? We have to draw the line somewhere.

My first place (out of uni) was a studio. I chose that because I didn't want to live with room mates. It didn't have a kitchen or a living room - and it was *waayyyy* cheaper than getting a place by myself with a kitchen and a living room. I'm glad that properties like that existed.

1124,"Again I think it varies by career and cost-of-living (NYC or LA would barely be a step up comparing wage vs rent I’m betting). I think the wedge of rich vs poor is getting hiked globally, and some poor areas of this country are surreal in how abysmal they are (still unsure if they fixed Flint, Michigan, but it was something out of a Dickens novel that should not have happened in the 21st century). 

I also don’t think the distinction between poor vs. unequal means much when they’re linked. Poverty and property tax have been tools to divide resources for ions, and it’s progressed. It’s why redlining was so important for racists in the 1940s and Black Americans still feel the effects of that today. When you have too much money, there’s no high in buying things anymore. The only thing left is exclusivity, and it’s been done to access to healthy food/exercise, safe neighborhoods/streets, boutique items or local made specialty places, things that are made well, leisure time and activities, etc. etc. They won’t stop doing it until they’re properly red taped — We’d still be working industrial revolution 14 hour days/6 day weeks in menial body breaking jobs had people not gone on strike and demanded it was put into law. 

They ran an article yesterday in the New York Times about how wealthy overweight women are making Ozempic and other diabetes/obesity drugs harder to get because they’re using them as diet pills. Poor people put on pounds because healthy food items poor people have relied on have hiked in price (because of foodie obsession or just inflation) and streets have been cut up/been more polluted with cars, and they work longer harder hours and accumulate more stress (cortisol has been linked with weight gain). And instead of fix any of that, they’d rather just fix the rich people who receive friendly fire. Now they treat these chubby rich people with “miracle drugs”, and then fill their gaunt faces with filler (or other body fat that didn’t come off) when they inevitably deflate. I didn’t mean to go off sequitur as much but the sheer vanity of it gagged me. 

I feel badly that Britain/London is hitting a slump, and I hope that they can pull out of it.

1149,"No, that's not how it works. Prices aren't some arbitrary amount pegged to a general consensus of what people think is ""sensible"".

Prices are determined by the amount of supply compared to the demand. 

If living rooms are being converted into bedrooms, then the total number of bedrooms available is higher.

Going the other way, if it's illegal to rent out properties without a living room, then bedrooms will have to be converted and tenants will have to be evicted. And the total number of available bedrooms will be lower to the same number of people. 

Yeah the people who can afford properties will have a living room, but anyone who was living in a studio, or a was the 3rd person in 3-bedroom flat share with no living room will be shit out of luck, and will need to compete for the now more-limited number of rooms.

Imagine you're an (evil) landlord renting to 3 people in a place with no living room. You're gonna legally have to kick someone out. If no one wants to move, now you've got a bidding war between the the 3 people, and the per-room cost will go up for the tenants, and it will be a lot because no one can be the person without a place.

1190,"It’s a fair point, but it’s ultimately it’s not the landlords who are making these decisions. There are plenty of places to rent that have living rooms. They’re just extremely expensive.

Similarly, there are also lots of studio flats where there is no separate kitchen. And they are much cheaper than places with a separate living room.

If you want to have a separate living room, nothing stops you from paying more, except lack of money.

If we outlaw studios, the price of places with separate living rooms doesn’t go down. In fact they become more expensive, since there will be people who otherwise would choose to live in smaller accommodation, who lose the option and now fork out the extra money (somehow) for the living room, and everyone will be competing.

So the choices are let people have the option of no living room, and have lower rental prices. Or force them to pay more for a now more expensive living room.

I realise this is the same argument for say, a bathroom or fire safety. And yes, for those things I do think we should force people to pay more. I don’t think people should have the option to risk their health and lives, because I think that cost ends up being paid for elsewhere (E.g. NHS).

Perhaps you think that the mental health toll of not having a living room is similarly damaging. I possibly could be convinced of that, I totally agree that mental health is important.

But just recognise that the choice to pass such a law would be a deliberate choice to raise rents, so the benefit to the general public needs to be weighed against that reality.

1205,"Indeed, and the politicians won't stop adding people to the population endlessly at rates far faster than we can even hope to build for.

It's insanity, and all about pumping up all their numbers, to our very serious and real detriment.

We need to be more like Japan, in many ways, where you can still get a property in a commutable suburb of Tokyo for circa £150k, and a place to live entirely free in rural areas due to the naturally declining population. We would be in a similar position to Japan and the way things were in the 90s if our government focused on economic growth via education and industry instead of just pumping the numbers to increase job and housing market competition over the last 25 years.

Edit: why is this being downvoted so much? Is it because people don't like the truth? It's a very simple case of supply and demand. Demand is far higher than we can supply for. It doesn't matter whether you like the truth or not, that's the truth. Otherwise actually speak your opinion please.

1240,"I'm also 35, and still renting with friends. I get along well with them so it's generally been a positive to be living with friends, and it's not been until the last couple of years that I could have really afforded a place on my own.

I am at the point now where I am getting tired of having so little space, would like somewhere bigger to myself, and could afford it. But I'm also now at the point where I can almost afford to buy somewhere, so I'll likely just aim for that. It doesn't seem worth the extra hassle to move to another rental place on my own where I'll be paying twice the rent, when my current living situation is relatively stable, and the landlord hasn't increased the rent for years.

With rents as expensive as they are, the crossover between being able to afford renting a (half decent) place on your own, and affording to buy seems pretty small - not to mention when you are renting on your own, your ability to save towards buying a house will take a big hit. It all depends on your situation and priorities though, I guess. If I didn't have the opportunity to live with friends that I've known for 10 years, I would have definitely prioritised renting somewhere on my own sooner, as I've not enjoyed sharing with people I don't know in the past.

As for your last point, I doubt you'll have much trouble finding landlords that are willing to have older people living in their house. Our landlord seemed particularly happy to have some slightly older working people renting her house, compared to students or younger people, since we're more likely to pay our rent on time and not cause problems. She does seem an exception to the rule though, just owns and rents out one house since moving away, and manages it directly, rather than through an agency. I guess there are a section that are generally against professional sharers for whatever reason, and prefer couples/families, and then there's a section that are specifically geared towards students. Renting a room in a shared house where your much older than the others may be problematic, though probably at least as much for you as it is for the other tenants.

Ultimately London is, unfortunately, a very expensive place to live. It does seem like the majority of people who stick around are either younger people who are happy to share and saving up for something bigger, or have ""made it"" and earn well enough to be able to buy. Not to mention it's obviously easier to afford something bigger if you're in a relationship with someone and splitting the cost. It's definitely rough for those in between, but in the end I guess you have to make a choice between if living in London is important enough vs being able to afford a bigger place - it's likely to be cheaper and easier in other cities, or at least further out in the suburbs.",2023-04-20 15:59:21,12,london,comment,"Anyone here in their 30s, 40s, 50s (and possibly beyond!) still only renting a room in a shared flat or house?","[""'m"", 'also', '35', 'still', 'renting', 'friend', 'get', 'along', 'well', ""'s"", 'generally', 'positive', 'living', 'friend', ""'s"", 'last', 'couple', 'year', 'could', 'really', 'afforded', 'place', 'point', 'getting', 'tired', 'little', 'space', 'would', 'like', 'somewhere', 'bigger', 'could', 'afford', ""'m"", 'also', 'point', 'almost', 'afford', 'buy', 'somewhere', ""'ll"", 'likely', 'aim', ""n't"", 'seem', 'worth', 'extra', 'hassle', 'move', 'another', 'rental', 'place', ""'ll"", 'paying', 'twice', 'rent', 'current', 'living', 'situation', 'relatively', 'stable', 'landlord', ""n't"", 'increased', 'rent', 'year', 'rent', 'expensive', 'crossover', 'able', 'afford', 'renting', 'half', 'decent', 'place', 'affording', 'buy', 'seems', 'pretty', 'small', 'mention', 'renting', 'ability', 'save', 'towards', 'buying', 'house', 'take', 'big', 'hit', 'depends', 'situation', 'priority', 'though', 'guess', ""n't"", 'opportunity', 'live', 'friend', ""'ve"", 'known', '10', 'year', 'would', 'definitely', 'prioritised', 'renting', 'somewhere', 'sooner', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'sharing', 'people', ""n't"", 'know', 'past', 'last', 'point', 'doubt', ""'ll"", 'much', 'trouble', 'finding', 'landlord', 'willing', 'older', 'people', 'living', 'house', 'landlord', 'seemed', 'particularly', 'happy', 'slightly', 'older', 'working', 'people', 'renting', 'house', 'compared', 'student', 'younger', 'people', 'since', ""'re"", 'likely', 'pay', 'rent', 'time', 'cause', 'problem', 'seem', 'exception', 'rule', 'though', 'owns', 'rent', 'one', 'house', 'since', 'moving', 'away', 'manages', 'directly', 'rather', 'agency', 'guess', 'section', 'generally', 'professional', 'sharer', 'whatever', 'reason', 'prefer', 'couples/families', ""'s"", 'section', 'specifically', 'geared', 'towards', 'student', 'renting', 'room', 'shared', 'house', 'much', 'older', 'others', 'may', 'problematic', 'though', 'probably', 'least', 'much', 'tenant', 'ultimately', 'london', 'unfortunately', 'expensive', 'place', 'live', 'seem', 'like', 'majority', 'people', 'stick', 'around', 'either', 'younger', 'people', 'happy', 'share', 'saving', 'something', 'bigger', '``', 'made', ""''"", 'earn', 'well', 'enough', 'able', 'buy', 'mention', ""'s"", 'obviously', 'easier', 'afford', 'something', 'bigger', ""'re"", 'relationship', 'someone', 'splitting', 'cost', ""'s"", 'definitely', 'rough', 'end', 'guess', 'make', 'choice', 'living', 'london', 'important', 'enough', 'v', 'able', 'afford', 'bigger', 'place', ""'s"", 'likely', 'cheaper', 'easier', 'city', 'least', 'suburb']",0.6182633515402698,0.5203003738631604,0.5948119822922406

1337,"I agree with you that it really depends. For me the best scenario is sharing with friends you know REALLY well and the ideal is sharing with your partner.

In most cases you don't know the people you're going to share a flat if you're not renting a whole flat/house from the start.

It's not high-flying careers that give you the 'luxury' of living on your own. It's the role itself, the specialism and the company. You can find different salaries for the same role in different companies. It's a matter of luck, industry and experience.

Now that more companies are open to the idea of remote working (not all sadly) it is possible to find a place of your own (studio for example) outside London and in a small town but it also means you will not have the social life of London (if you have one in London). It really is a personal matter.

I know people who could afford living on their own but they preferred sharing with others because they did not want to live alone and they liked meeting other people.

Looking at the rents for 1-bed flats in London is really painful. For a decent place you have to give a fortune, plus bills, regardless of the zone!

1414,"I'm also 35, and still renting with friends. I get along well with them so it's generally been a positive to be living with friends, and it's not been until the last couple of years that I could have really afforded a place on my own.

I am at the point now where I am getting tired of having so little space, would like somewhere bigger to myself, and could afford it. But I'm also now at the point where I can almost afford to buy somewhere, so I'll likely just aim for that. It doesn't seem worth the extra hassle to move to another rental place on my own where I'll be paying twice the rent, when my current living situation is relatively stable, and the landlord hasn't increased the rent for years.

With rents as expensive as they are, the crossover between being able to afford renting a (half decent) place on your own, and affording to buy seems pretty small - not to mention when you are renting on your own, your ability to save towards buying a house will take a big hit. It all depends on your situation and priorities though, I guess. If I didn't have the opportunity to live with friends that I've known for 10 years, I would have definitely prioritised renting somewhere on my own sooner, as I've not enjoyed sharing with people I don't know in the past.

As for your last point, I doubt you'll have much trouble finding landlords that are willing to have older people living in their house. Our landlord seemed particularly happy to have some slightly older working people renting her house, compared to students or younger people, since we're more likely to pay our rent on time and not cause problems. She does seem an exception to the rule though, just owns and rents out one house since moving away, and manages it directly, rather than through an agency. I guess there are a section that are generally against professional sharers for whatever reason, and prefer couples/families, and then there's a section that are specifically geared towards students. Renting a room in a shared house where your much older than the others may be problematic, though probably at least as much for you as it is for the other tenants.

Ultimately London is, unfortunately, a very expensive place to live. It does seem like the majority of people who stick around are either younger people who are happy to share and saving up for something bigger, or have ""made it"" and earn well enough to be able to buy. Not to mention it's obviously easier to afford something bigger if you're in a relationship with someone and splitting the cost. It's definitely rough for those in between, but in the end I guess you have to make a choice between if living in London is important enough vs being able to afford a bigger place - it's likely to be cheaper and easier in other cities, or at least further out in the suburbs.",2023-04-20 15:59:21,12,london,comment,"Anyone here in their 30s, 40s, 50s (and possibly beyond!) still only renting a room in a shared flat or house?","[""'m"", 'also', '35', 'still', 'renting', 'friend', 'get', 'along', 'well', ""'s"", 'generally', 'positive', 'living', 'friend', ""'s"", 'last', 'couple', 'year', 'could', 'really', 'afforded', 'place', 'point', 'getting', 'tired', 'little', 'space', 'would', 'like', 'somewhere', 'bigger', 'could', 'afford', ""'m"", 'also', 'point', 'almost', 'afford', 'buy', 'somewhere', ""'ll"", 'likely', 'aim', ""n't"", 'seem', 'worth', 'extra', 'hassle', 'move', 'another', 'rental', 'place', ""'ll"", 'paying', 'twice', 'rent', 'current', 'living', 'situation', 'relatively', 'stable', 'landlord', ""n't"", 'increased', 'rent', 'year', 'rent', 'expensive', 'crossover', 'able', 'afford', 'renting', 'half', 'decent', 'place', 'affording', 'buy', 'seems', 'pretty', 'small', 'mention', 'renting', 'ability', 'save', 'towards', 'buying', 'house', 'take', 'big', 'hit', 'depends', 'situation', 'priority', 'though', 'guess', ""n't"", 'opportunity', 'live', 'friend', ""'ve"", 'known', '10', 'year', 'would', 'definitely', 'prioritised', 'renting', 'somewhere', 'sooner', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'sharing', 'people', ""n't"", 'know', 'past', 'last', 'point', 'doubt', ""'ll"", 'much', 'trouble', 'finding', 'landlord', 'willing', 'older', 'people', 'living', 'house', 'landlord', 'seemed', 'particularly', 'happy', 'slightly', 'older', 'working', 'people', 'renting', 'house', 'compared', 'student', 'younger', 'people', 'since', ""'re"", 'likely', 'pay', 'rent', 'time', 'cause', 'problem', 'seem', 'exception', 'rule', 'though', 'owns', 'rent', 'one', 'house', 'since', 'moving', 'away', 'manages', 'directly', 'rather', 'agency', 'guess', 'section', 'generally', 'professional', 'sharer', 'whatever', 'reason', 'prefer', 'couples/families', ""'s"", 'section', 'specifically', 'geared', 'towards', 'student', 'renting', 'room', 'shared', 'house', 'much', 'older', 'others', 'may', 'problematic', 'though', 'probably', 'least', 'much', 'tenant', 'ultimately', 'london', 'unfortunately', 'expensive', 'place', 'live', 'seem', 'like', 'majority', 'people', 'stick', 'around', 'either', 'younger', 'people', 'happy', 'share', 'saving', 'something', 'bigger', '``', 'made', ""''"", 'earn', 'well', 'enough', 'able', 'buy', 'mention', ""'s"", 'obviously', 'easier', 'afford', 'something', 'bigger', ""'re"", 'relationship', 'someone', 'splitting', 'cost', ""'s"", 'definitely', 'rough', 'end', 'guess', 'make', 'choice', 'living', 'london', 'important', 'enough', 'v', 'able', 'afford', 'bigger', 'place', ""'s"", 'likely', 'cheaper', 'easier', 'city', 'least', 'suburb']",0.6182633515402698,0.5203003738631604,0.5948119822922406

1511,"I agree with you that it really depends. For me the best scenario is sharing with friends you know REALLY well and the ideal is sharing with your partner.

In most cases you don't know the people you're going to share a flat if you're not renting a whole flat/house from the start.

It's not high-flying careers that give you the 'luxury' of living on your own. It's the role itself, the specialism and the company. You can find different salaries for the same role in different companies. It's a matter of luck, industry and experience.

Now that more companies are open to the idea of remote working (not all sadly) it is possible to find a place of your own (studio for example) outside London and in a small town but it also means you will not have the social life of London (if you have one in London). It really is a personal matter.

I know people who could afford living on their own but they preferred sharing with others because they did not want to live alone and they liked meeting other people.

Looking at the rents for 1-bed flats in London is really painful. For a decent place you have to give a fortune, plus bills, regardless of the zone!

Privacy - The only place you get to have privacy is your own room.
Sharing - You have to share communal spaces such as the kitchen and bathroom    and the most annoying bit is if someone is using the kitchen (in my case the kitchen is fairly small) you have to wait for your turn to go cook yourself a meal. Same thing goes for using the shower. 
No sense of feeling at home - I cannot wait to move elsewhere and get my own place, use the kitchen/bathroom whenever I feel like it and without the need of being mindful of others.

1596,"I guess this is just a bit of a rant to share my frustration about the state of the room rental market in London. I'm having to move and just started searching for rooms and I forgot just how shocking and demeaning the whole process is. I've seen a couple of places and what was on offer was just pure squalor, bathtubs rusting, tatty furniture - the thing is you can't see the reality of it all in the photos, you have to see it for yourself in person.

I feel like a piece of meat, like a cash cow, no dignity to be had here. I call the phone numbers on Spare Room, Facebook, Zoopla, mostly no answer, I leave a voicemail, never get a callback, my messages echo in a black hole, as no replies are to be seen, agents' number one line that they simply have to say to you 'Let me know ASAP because the room is gonna go instantly'. And the scams! Oh the scams! Ads that show compilations of spacious rooms from a variety of houses offering a promise of reasonable rent only to reel you in - Sorry that's not available! But we have 10 other (more expensive) rooms.

I'm being shown around properties by what looks like a 17-year-old boy. Agents 45 min late, not bothering to let me know or apologise, while I wait outside the property in the middle of my workday. One thing I learned the hard way - don't mention you work from home, because you might be a more undesirable tenant - being discriminated against because you work from home is a brand new area to navigate.

Did I mention 'agents' who can't write a full, grammatically correct sentence?

I think this is just the beginning of things I will see this time around. The things I have seen in London I have never ever seen in any of the other 4 European countries I lived in. It really makes me question sometimes why I even bother being here.

That's my first week in room hunting, joy!

We had been to aroun 20 viewings in June with my girlfriend and 17 of the 20 flats we've seen looked like the pictures of them had been taken a good 10yrs prior. Most of them had holes in the walls, smelled awful, a few of them had single mattresses littered all over the floors (Romanians most likely), were terribly dirty to the point that we would spent a good few months just to clean it.

The best part of it all? Agencies as well as the landlords don't seem to see the issue with trying to rent something in such a terrible state to someone.
Heck, even we were forced to re-paint all of the rooms ourselves because landlord said he won't do it, and the walls looked terrible.

You need to literally go through hell nowadays to find something to rent in London that doesn't look like it had been chewed up, eaten and vomited out by a troll.

Not mentioning that our contract stated that for the duration of the tenancy we agree not to change our jobs? Can you believe that crap? They thought we won't read it or something I guess, but we pointed out that it's just ridiculous and they removed it. 

Long story short, me and my girlfriend came to the same conclusion after renting rooms for the past few years before we moved in together for the 1st time last year:

1800,"This is a bit of a rant but advice needed. 

It seems like every flat share that I look at seems to have a bunch of people that want to socialise.

If I had the financial ability I would rent alone but I do want to save my money not spend it on rent just yet or a home. And in London unfortunately THE ONLY AFFORDABLE way to live alone between 600-1000, where you want to live is through sharing. 

Personally I look at moving out to get independence and have a HOME to relax in not socialise. I work so hard and need my rest. 

Obviously I could rest but then it will come across rude and that's what I don't want. I am not good at socialising. I like watching my own TV shows in my room or lounge, not talking unless required. I can small talk but I feel like it is so much effort to sacrifice things I like to speak and socialise with house mates. Also I get nervous. I get nervous doing things I'm forced/not comfortable doing and then I get quiet, even though I don't mean to. Previously when I house shared for many years I would be really upset teary and depressed knowing everytime I left my room I would have to face people and talk. Not in a bad way to the people but I feel like I should just be able to relax and do my thing without so much effort 😔 

It seems like in London all the flat share are my aged people who want to make friends, do things together, eat together, everything. And I can't find a way to find a home or flat share to filter this out. It's quiet sad because all the homes in my price range have flat mates who want a friend rather than a tenant 😔 obviously I don't mind friends but I can't have friends 24 7 I just like my space. 

In other countries it is respected and common to have some privacy but in London that's not the case.

I had a 'living room' sized bedroom which was huge for £650 a month including all bills and a parking spot on the drive. Our notice got given because the landlord next door wanted to renovate and have his newly wedded son move in. Until then, though, it was perfect and exactly what I wanted. Nobody bothered each other, but was not rude to each other. Everyone gave each other their space, and there were no problems with water or heating or anything.

What should I look for in the contract to see whether it binds all the housemates together?

I think if it was the house mates then it makes sense why they come across so needy, specific, and temperamental in their posts 

I lived in accommodation that had a tiny open plan living room and I found that I made so many friends because there wasn't pressure to socialise. We would go out every few weekends, sometimes they would cook for me or watch movies with me and it was nice because we all respected each other space we weren't attached and it wasn't offensive if we left to be in our room!

The flat does not have sufficient space/amenities for 4 people (single washing machine, single fridge/freezer, etc.) and I would not have signed a contract had I know this was an option. The contract reads as if there is an understanding the property is for 3 occupants as it mentions I have to pay 30% of the utilities in accordance with the number of rooms. 

With all the people looking to rent in London why couldn't they have just let us stay as a 3 person house? Our old flatmate is still paying bills until his contract ends in May so they had plenty of time to find someone but they've got the new couple moving in next week!

1892,"The landlord of my current place put up an advert stating that he wanted someone to make this their home and who would socialise with the other flatmates. I met two of them who seemed fairly quiet but nice (hadn't met the other two).    I live with four people, everyone eats in their room (despite having a dining room with a table) and most people wear headphones when they enter the kitchen. It's not uncommon to go four days without even a 'hey, how are you?'.  The only real communication is the house whatsapp group which is really a passive aggressive complaints bulletin board.

I might be moving because one of the two I hadn't met is the housemate from hell and the landlord is very sympathetic. However, I don't know whether to hope that my next house share will be more sociable than this. I've had friends say their work colleagues describe their experience of moving in with randoms in London as very similar to mine (minus the housemate from hell).  Perhaps I am more extroverted than most people and people more introverted than myself feel drained after a day of making small talk in the office don't want to bother with that when they get home.   However, I subletted whilst I flathunted though and my temporary flatmate was very sociable (we generally ate meals together - he even cooked for me for a couple of times and we  did something sociable together out the house about once a week).

TLDR:  Can moving in with randoms in London ever lead to a social house or do people tend to just eat in their rooms and not talk?
