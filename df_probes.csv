participant 2,no ,"I live in London ‘Cause at the moment it provides work, life and study opportunities I desire and hadn't found in my homecountry.

I live in the North of Dalston and I currently share a flat with two other people. We have two ""bedrooms"" (one of the spaces was intended to be a living room but we use it as a bedroom), one kitchen and one bathroom. Me and one of the flatmates share a bedroom and the other flatmate has a bedroom for himself. My monthly rent is £500 excluding bills. Apart from the kitchen, we do not have communal spaces, but the building has communal balconies which I'd consider social spots for all the floor's residents. The parking area inside the building block can also be considered a communal space? Hahaha. 

What do I see - my room, ""office"" and gathering space
What would i change - overall, i'm really fine with it. There are some stuff from my flatmate which I think occupies a lot of space and I think could go, but there's nothing I can do about it hahahaa. If I could, I'd probably replace the grey sofa-bed for something slightly smaller in width.
What does it say about my life - The objects in it and the way they are arrange give cues on my interests (e.g.: spray cans show I'm into muralism and graffiti; the scrap & ceramic sculptures show i'm into making sculptures with recycled materials, the amount of plants show i like plants etc) . Most of the pictures and art in the room are pieces done by friends of mine, which I guess shows I like to keep people I love near me through their art. The shelf with books show the topics my roomate and I are interested in. That shelf was given to us and I love how tall it is and how much stuff fits in it. Also, a lot of the objects in the pictures do not belong to me, so they show that I'm sharing an intimate space with someone who has their own interests (e.g.: massive speakers, sound recorders for music production etc that belong to my roomate). Lastly, the size of the room means that we can host friends and people if we want / need to, which I find quite an amazing possibility in one's life :) What do I see - the kitchen, where we all cook, where we sometimes eat together and socialise
What would I change - I mean, in an ideal world I'd love the kitchen to have a window and a larger table where we could fit more people. I find the kitchen a bit dark, but it's great regardless
What dos it say about my life - nothing, really . 
What do I see - my bed & window
What would I change - nothing
What dos it say about my life - that I love the colour blue, I'm used to sleep on mattresses on the floor and really prioritise having my bed close to a window (?)","1. how am i feeling today - serene and slightly introverted 

3. what do i think about my home? are there any differences between my home now and my home in my childhood? - i'm grateful for the place where i currently live. I lived in quite a lot of different places in my childhood, moved cities and moved houses about 5 times. Obviously all these places were different amongst themselves and in comparison to where I am now. I guess one of the main differences between my current place and the places I spend my childhood is that the current one is quite high (4th floor), and I was always at ground floor or in houses in my childhood, never apartments/ flats. I always had a little outside green space with some grass / ""garden"" in all the places I ever lived, and there's none in the present one.

4. 5 rules in my house share and why - 

we don't really have any rules. If I had to come up with ""unspoken rules"", I think the only one would be 

- not leaving dishes unwashed for too long (very subjective, sometimes we leave dishes for days and there was never a problem about it) and leaving the kitchen and bathroom at a state we'd all like to encounter.

other than that, we really do whatever we want and never established any ""rules"". We prefer to count on each other's judgement and notion of respect, which works. Things like smoking, listening to loud music, having people over, hosting parties etc are things we always do, and never had to discuss any rules about it 'cause I think we're all very aligned when it comes to respect and consideration.","1- that never happened

2- during the pandemic back in 2020 it was quite important for my mental health that was I sharing a space with other people. I think my housemates and I played a crucial role in keeping each other sane during isolation; we’d gather, talk, have meals together etc. Lockdown in London meant that, for a few months, we were the only people we would see / interact with in person. Our moments of gathering in each other’s rooms, cooking together, smoking or sunbathing together in one of my former housemate’s terrace (her bedroom was the only one that had a terrace) was super important, I believe for all of us. 

3 - I found this house through the platform RightMove

4- when I was living a nomadic life and backpacking, I spent 6 months volunteering and living in different hostels. Living in a hostel is quite a different dynamic from living in a shared house, even though both are shared living spaces, because you also need to work where you live, and you’re (usually) sharing a bedroom with all your work colleagues. Hostel volunteers come and go, most people stay for about 1-6 months. It happened that this one guy, who was my friend at the beginning, (and who was also volunteering) was quite disrespectful with my clearly vocalised boundaries (e.g.: I’d tell him “I need to study right now, I can’t chat”, and he’d insist, stay on the room, and keep interacting with me), until it escalated to him being physically pushy one day in the kitchen, grabbing my waist and touching me way too much without my consent, which made me have to make a scene in front of everyone (I said out loud so everyone in the kitchen could hear: “Can you fucking stop touching me? I told you 4 times already, I’m not fucking joking”). After that it was all in peace hahahah he stopped for good and our work colleagues kept him accountable. But it was definitely a momentary moment of stress and discomfort.","
1- depends on the housemate. With person I share a room with I spend quite a lot of time, especially at the end of the day (dinner etc). We also hang out quite a lot outside the house. The other flatmate works quite a lot and is rarely free to socialise. Some days I only see them once or twice a week.

2- With my roomate, yes. We often stretch/ do yoga, and journal/ write together in the morning, and sometimes we take turns to cook dinner. It's not uncommon for us to go for walks after dinner as well. At the moment, we're reading a book together, so about 3 or 4 days a week we have reading sessions (taking turns to read out loud to each other) before going to bed. I never actually realised that, but quite naturally we also built this habit of sitting together every Sunday night to plan the week ahead, put plans in our calendars and just talk about the week that we just lived. With my other flatmate, there's nothing regular, even thought the two of us go for drinks every now and then (I'd say once every 2 or 3 months)

3- Laid back, safe, open and mature. I think the 3 of us are very interested and focused on our own lives and work, and don't have any desire to put energy into gossip or passive-aggressiveness (as I've experienced in former shared spaces).  We rely on each other's common sense and treat each other as adults, with autonomy and respect. I feel that we all care about each other's wellbeing - even if we are not super close -, and treat each other like we'd like to be treated. In a lot of ways, that's basic.","DAY 5 - YOUR IDEAL HOME

1. what changes would i make in communal spaces (kitchen, parking area, balcony):

KITCHEN
a) have a window. 
reasoning: the kitchen has zero windows and needs constant artificial lighting, which is a big put-off for us. Natural light is so important for wellbeing and it'd make staying in the kitchen much more pleasant. Plus, it'd increase the chances of my flatmates and I wanting to use it (the kitchen) as a shared/communal space where we hang out/ eat together. Also - I often want to eat in the kitchen, because I'm a big fan of separating the place I sleep from the place I eat, but because of the lack of light, it happens with some frequency that I end up going to the bedroom simply because there's natural light + a view in there.

b) have a kitchen table that accommodates all of us
reasoning: I think having a table in which we could all have a meal together would be so healthy for all of us. As I said, I'm a big fan of separating the bedroom space from the eating space, and often, when I'm by myself or with another flatmate, we eat in the kitchen - but if the 3 of us decided to do that, there'd simply be no space. Having a table that is appropriate for the amount of people that live in the flat would be cool. But it's not a big deal. 

PARKING AREA

one super cool thing we have suggested to the building management recently is to turn the car park plant boxes (which don't really have any plants, just dirt) into a residents' communal vegetables and flowers garden :) . Talking to people living in the building, we also realised it's quite cool to leave some stools and chairs downstairs to sit and chat.

BALCONY 

I think there's absolutely nothing I'd change about the balcony. I love it and it works so well as a communal space :)


obs: none of this would ""significantly enhance my quality of life"". I'm pretty good already.

2. does my current home align with my ideal of a living space?
No, but matching my living space to my ideal of a shared living space is not my priority either. It works pretty well for me, even though is not ""my ideal"". ""My ideal"" is not definitive/eternal, and depends on my situation - and for my current one , I love it. 

However, here are a few points that would probably make me love my place even more
a) having access to a garden - to host parties, to hang out with friends, to plant food, to sunbathe, to write, to stretch in the morning.
b) having a ""work area"" separate from where my bed stays, so I could work and study in a space that's different from where I rest. and withdraw.


Long term housing plans

1. do I plan to live in my current place long-term?
for at least the next 2 years, yes. 

What factors influence my decision?
Convenience - which includes location, price, the tranquility of the sharing and chillness of the coexisting with my flatmates

2. Describe my ideal home in detail
see, this is not something that I think about at all. I'm quite satisfied, and ""having an ideal home"" is not my priority. 

However, If you asked me what an environment I'd like to live in would look like, I'd say communal living is definitely what I aim for. I think this ideal of living in a private space that is to be shared only what is considered a ""romantic partnership"" or blood-related-family doesn't help humans create community practices, collaborative problem-solving and collective development/ resilience. I want to have the privilege of sharing a living space with a community that shares the same quest for managing to cooperate, share responsibilities, income, and love, and develop a deep - and never-ending - research on mutual respect. I think communal / shared living spaces can be revolutionary spaces. To challenge traditional societal norms around individualism and ownership, promoting a model based on cooperation and mutual support - that'd be my dream / ideal. To share a living a place with folks who embodied (or are seeking to embody) NVC, who prioritise inclusive governance, resource sharing and developing practical alternatives to capitalism, constantly researching how to know ourselves and others better - something I believe leads to greater social cohesion, harmony and resilience. PLus, I really couldn't picture myself living all by myself or with a +1. That'd be so weird hahahha :)

no i don't have specific steps to achieve this ""goal"" cos it's not a goal for the present. ","Day 1

participant 3,yes,"I would change the size of the room if possible because right now the council say
it is legally too small for an adult. Increasing the space would allow me to engage
in more activities comfortably and have a clearer headspace, which would help
my overall well-being. Having a bigger room would mean being able to incorporate
more furniture, like a chair for reading or a desk - right now I study on my bed.
However, I would not change the personal touches and the sense of safety my
room provides. The decorations (I don’t have an updated photo unfortunately),
the way the bed is, and the items that hold sentimental value all contribute to
making this small space feel like home. Overall, I feel like my room shows my
ability to adapt and make the best of my circumstances, creating a safe space
even within limited constraints. I have been able to make the space functional and
personal.
Regarding the garden, I would change the dynamics of how the space is used. My
housemates smoke weed a few times each evening, which makes me feel
excluded. Ideally, I would like to find a compromise where this activity is moved to
a different part of the property so that the garden can be a more inclusive space.
However, I would not change the overall setup and ambience of the garden. We
have a good amount of greenery and seating which will be good for when there is
better weather.","Looking at the floor plan now, I realise how much communal space there is, and
how much my housemates and I don’t collectively use it! I feel overall positive
about my house but I wish we made the most of the space together. This differs
from my childhood home, where my family would always eat together and use the
living room to play games and watch TV. I guess that's because in this house, we
are all doing our own thing and different lives, but it would be nice to have more
shared moments and build a stronger sense of community within the house.

Initially when we moved in, we made some loose rules between us to keep
everyone happy, but we haven’t stuck to these:
 Quiet Hours After 11 PM:
We agreed to maintain quiet hours after 10 PM because one housemate
gets up for work very early.
Cleaning Schedule:
We were supposed to make a cleaning rota but we never did - this means
me and one other housemate are often the ones to clean up all the mess.
No Smoking Indoors:
We said not to smoke inside, but now my housemates also smoke in the
room next to my bedroom, as well as in the garden below my room.
One thing we do stick to well is equally share expenses for household
items such as cleaning supplies and toilet paper.","Day Three - 1. A time that brought me to tears was when I was woken up many times in the night and early morning by slamming doors and loud talking and laughing. I work night shifts and I’m always careful when I get home to not make any noise. I wish my housemates could be a bit more respectful sometimes when they know I’ve been working. 2. However, a time that made me feel happy was when my housemates made a sign for me coming home after a while away. It made me feel missed and appreciated.","Day Four - 1. Each week roughly 1 hour on average, recently around 2 hours. I think my other housemates overall spend a lot more time together because they smoke together 2. Since it’s gotten warmer, we sometimes go to the local markets together and walk along the canal. It’s become a new routine for us and I really enjoy it. 3.

I think that my housemates may stay living in London together but I’ll be going to my family home for a bit before I maybe travel. Parts of me can’t wait to move out and have some proper space again - my room is too small for me to stay there another year. 1.2: Ideal location is somewhere sunny abroad, and the house would be a flat with an open kitchen and sofa area. The most important thing is having enough space and storage for me to put my things away so that I can have a tidy home (for mental health) but secondly, I would like a nice community feel to the area or who I am sharing with in the future.

participant 4,no ,"I was living in shared accomodation for my final year of university 2023 October until 2024 March in Dalston Junction. There were 5 rooms in the flat, which added up to 6 people in total as I shared one room with my friend. The monthly rent for our one room was 1150 bills not included. There was a shared kitchen with a little table and garden but I never used it because it was too cold, I’m sure in summer it would be nice


These are pictures of the room that the landlord took because my friend was so messy that I never took a single picture there. The kitchen and garden pictures are mine. My shared room used to be the living room.  which is why there is a sofa and tv in there. It’s quite fitting for your research. I can see a big room with potential to be very comfortable, there is space and a nice sized window and storage. I would change the shelving to be closed if it was my choice, the items are very exposed. 
I would say they show how dire the housing crisis in London is because I was forced to share a bed with someone to save money 🥲 and
It shows how disgusting and messy my flatmate was and how hard it must have been to live with her. (I only had one suitcase to compare, none of the things in that room were mine) If I could change something it would be for the room to be clean","This photo is things that represent me, it’s my old room when I lived alone and the pictures on th fridge are of me and friends and items given to me by my students. Pictures from when I was travelling and relaxing make me feel free. I took this photo when I did small boat tour to a few islands in Vietnam and we were resting on the beach before going to the next destination. 
I took the picture because I wanted to remember that moment and how beautiful the ocean looks. It tells me that my life is privileged enough to be able to travel and reminds me that there is so much more of the world to see. 
This picture I took after I put my mini Christmas tree up. I like to take pictures of my room to remember how it looks since I don’t have a good memory. It shows my life as a student, there are lots of books but also pictures of all the people I met and small keepsakes that I was given showing that my students liked me, it reminds me that I really loved my life at that time. 
The thing that makes me feel free here is the ocean.
this picture was taken in my shared kitchen, it makes me miss that time when I liked my routine there. I would cook good food and watch my show in the kitchen enjoying the sunshine or rain. I always take pictures like this when I enjoyed the food and like to remember my daily routine at different points in my life. It shows that my life at that time was quite relaxed and I was looked after during my studies","I was feeling quite good today because the weather is so lovely. I had a very important exam but it didn’t go too bad. 

1.⁠ ⁠Most of my time living in that place I would leave at 8:30 when I woke up and come home around midnight after the university library closed. I really couldn’t stand having to go home and I couldn’t take it one day after I had a really horrible day but I knew I had to face my roommate and even talk to everyone else in the kitchen so I stood outside the front door of the flat crying, one flatmate noticed my shadow and came to ask if I was okay and I said I just need a minute by myself. 
2.⁠ ⁠A nice moment was when a new flatmate moved in and his sister came for a few days too, we all stood in the kitchen talking for hours. Also when we would share food with each other or talk in the kitchen (the other paragraph looks like I hated it but I was just very stressed that day, usually I love to talk with everyone!) 
3.⁠ ⁠I had a very low budget since I knew I couldn’t work this year and would be living off of student finance. The housing situation in London is also quite difficult so I was searching for a place for a long time with no luck, although every option was a shared housing situation so I feel like there is no choice in London unless you’re very rich 
4.⁠ ⁠⁠I felt uncomfortable when my roommate wouldn’t stop taking to me and even if I went to the kitchen to study or cook she would follow me in there and keep talking to me so I felt like there was nowhere I could go. Also there was one older male flatmate who would purposely come in the kitchen if I was there and talk to me. Some flatmates didn’t wash the dishes or kitchen properly too and that was something we shared. 
The little kitchen table has the most significance to me! I spent a lot of time there since I always cooked at home and I loved how the sunshine came in through the window in the daytime too. 
I would remove all of my roommates things!! Haha but realistically the second photo makes more sense. Very often people used to leave their expired food here on this counter and I would always have to throw it out but I didn’t want to do it myself so I would wait to see if they would do it and they never did. 
The first picture doesn’t show the extent of how much stuff my roommate had but it was much more than any person needs shich made me feel suffocated and anxious too. The kitchen as well had expired food and the fridge ended up smelling terrible too because of this. A cleaner came to clean it but she was incredibly rude and threw away literally everything from the fridge including al of our sauces, ingredients, drinks etc which many were expensive, especially for my roommate who had most things shipped from Korea and was struggling to pay rent on top of this, she went crazy after this and the smell never went away","My day has been good, I did many things since I’ve been waking up early.

1.⁠ ⁠About 1 or 1 and a half hours listening to my roommate speak, sometimes more if I’m in the house longer. Other flatmates I didn’t spend time with 
2.⁠ ⁠⁠We didn’t have any routines or activities 
3.⁠ ⁠⁠The atmosphere changed with different flatmates. There were two flatmates that made the place uncomfortable and 3 that made it very nice which included the landlord. The two that made the place uncomfortable usually complained about how we pay the bills and just generally had a bad attitude whereas the other 3 were chatty and kind.
One thing that was nice to share was cutlery, pots pans etc because we never had to worry about it we didn’t have something. So I didn’t mind sharing mine too. What I preferred to keep private was shampoo conditioner and body things because I have special shampoo and conditioner for dyed blonde hair and people were using it when I left it in the shower so I always kept it in the room after that. I don’t have a picture from that time but I kept it in this bag on my desk to easily access. 
And the place that brought us together was the kitchen which I pictured before as we would always talk to each other if we were there at the same time. 
","I’m feeling okay today. 

1.⁠ ⁠I would just improve the cleanliness of the shared spaces because some people don’t treat them very well although this wouldn’t really change my quality of life as I still used the kitchen and bathroom as usual. I think there’s not a lot I would change, I didn’t have many problems 
2.⁠ ⁠My ideal living space would be a studio I suppose, much more comfortable and no stress. Shared housing feels like you’re always holding out until one day you become rich enough to get out.


1.⁠ ⁠I tried to leave that house after the first month and a half because I couldn’t stand my roommate but she refused to move and I paid all of the deposit myself so I couldn’t leave her there in case she ruined the place. I think living in a normal situation in shared housing would be fine with me as long as the other people are clean and respectful, even better if they’re fun to hang out with. Where I will live long term is too difficult to pin point right now because I’m graduating university and will be out of London for the summer. When I come back I will find another temporary place for a year and the same after that year so it’s hard to say. 
2.⁠ ⁠⁠Realistically my future long term place after graduating would be a shared home but I think the most important thing for me is cost. Distance doesn’t worry me as I enjoy commuting as long as I can save money and don’t find it a hassle since I usually study or read at that time. Size and community is not so much an issue too as long as I have my own space that’s fine with me. I’m usually not in my room much at all. Having a nice community within the household would be ideal but not essential. 
3.⁠ ⁠⁠My steps to achieve my ideal home would first be to graduate and find a good paying job! I don’t have any specific goals yet though. 
I love soft yellow lighting! My old flat had one of these big lights and it made the kitchen feel very cosy. If a future living space of mine had this in the communal area I think it would be much nicer. I’m not really sure what promotes a good sense of community or positive social interactions. I think it will just depend on the people you meet.

I was living in shared accommodation for my final year of university 2023 October until 2024 March in Dalston Junction. There were 5 rooms in the flat, which added up to 6 people in total as I shared one room with my friend. The monthly rent for our one room was 1150 bills not included. There was a shared kitchen with a little table and garden but I never used it because it was too cold, I’m sure in summer it would be nice


These are pictures of the room that the landlord took because my friend was so messy that I never took a single picture there. The kitchen and garden pictures are mine. My shared room used to be the living room.  which is why there is a sofa and tv in there. It’s quite fitting for your research. I can see a big room with potential to be very comfortable, there is space and a nice sized window and storage. I would change the shelving to be closed if it was my choice, the items are very exposed. 
I would say they show how dire the housing crisis in London is because I was forced to share a bed with someone to save money 🥲 and
It shows how disgusting and messy my flatmate was and how hard it must have been to live with her. (I only had one suitcase to compare, none of the things in that room were mine) If I could change something it would be for the room to be clean


Day 2 
This photo is things that represent me, it’s my old room when I lived alone and the pictures on th fridge are of me and friends and items given to me by my students. Pictures from when I was travelling and relaxing make me feel free. I took this photo when I did small boat tour to a few islands in Vietnam and we were resting on the beach before going to the next destination. 
I took the picture because I wanted to remember that moment and how beautiful the ocean looks. It tells me that my life is privileged enough to be able to travel and reminds me that there is so much more of the world to see. 
This picture I took after I put my mini Christmas tree up. I like to take pictures of my room to remember how it looks since I don’t have a good memory. It shows my life as a student, there are lots of books but also pictures of all the people I met and small keepsakes that I was given showing that my students liked me, it reminds me that I really loved my life at that time. 
The thing that makes me feel free here is the ocean.
this picture was taken in my shared kitchen, it makes me miss that time when I liked my routine there. I would cook good food and watch my show in the kitchen enjoying the sunshine or rain. I always take pictures like this when I enjoyed the food and like to remember my daily routine at different points in my life. It shows that my life at that time was quite relaxed and I was looked after during my studies

Day 3
I was feeling quite good today because the weather is so lovely. I had a very important exam but it didn’t go too bad. 

1.⁠ ⁠Most of my time living in that place I would leave at 8:30 when I woke up and come home around midnight after the university library closed. I really couldn’t stand having to go home and I couldn’t take it one day after I had a really horrible day but I knew I had to face my roommate and even talk to everyone else in the kitchen so I stood outside the front door of the flat crying, one flatmate noticed my shadow and came to ask if I was okay and I said I just need a minute by myself. 
2.⁠ ⁠A nice moment was when a new flatmate moved in and his sister came for a few days too, we all stood in the kitchen talking for hours. Also when we would share food with each other or talk in the kitchen (the other paragraph looks like I hated it but I was just very stressed that day, usually I love to talk with everyone!) 
3.⁠ ⁠I had a very low budget since I knew I couldn’t work this year and would be living off of student finance. The housing situation in London is also quite difficult so I was searching for a place for a long time with no luck, although every option was a shared housing situation so I feel like there is no choice in London unless you’re very rich 
4.⁠ ⁠⁠I felt uncomfortable when my roommate wouldn’t stop taking to me and even if I went to the kitchen to study or cook she would follow me in there and keep talking to me so I felt like there was nowhere I could go. Also there was one older male flatmate who would purposely come in the kitchen if I was there and talk to me. Some flatmates didn’t wash the dishes or kitchen properly too and that was something we shared. 
The little kitchen table has the most significance to me! I spent a lot of time there since I always cooked at home and I loved how the sunshine came in through the window in the daytime too. 
I would remove all of my roommates things!! Haha but realistically the second photo makes more sense. Very often people used to leave their expired food here on this counter and I would always have to throw it out but I didn’t want to do it myself so I would wait to see if they would do it and they never did. 
The first picture doesn’t show the extent of how much stuff my roommate had but it was much more than any person needs shich made me feel suffocated and anxious too. The kitchen as well had expired food and the fridge ended up smelling terrible too because of this. A cleaner came to clean it but she was incredibly rude and threw away literally everything from the fridge including al of our sauces, ingredients, drinks etc which many were expensive, especially for my roommate who had most things shipped from Korea and was struggling to pay rent on top of this, she went crazy after this and the smell never went away

Day 4 
My day has been good, I did many things since I’ve been waking up early.

1.⁠ ⁠About 1 or 1 and a half hours listening to my roommate speak, sometimes more if I’m in the house longer. Other flatmates I didn’t spend time with 
2.⁠ ⁠⁠We didn’t have any routines or activities 
3.⁠ ⁠⁠The atmosphere changed with different flatmates. There were two flatmates that made the place uncomfortable and 3 that made it very nice which included the landlord. The two that made the place uncomfortable usually complained about how we pay the bills and just generally had a bad attitude whereas the other 3 were chatty and kind.
One thing that was nice to share was cutlery, pots pans etc because we never had to worry about it we didn’t have something. So I didn’t mind sharing mine too. What I preferred to keep private was shampoo conditioner and body things because I have special shampoo and conditioner for dyed blonde hair and people were using it when I left it in the shower so I always kept it in the room after that. I don’t have a picture from that time but I kept it in this bag on my desk to easily access. 
And the place that brought us together was the kitchen which I pictured before as we would always talk to each other if we were there at the same time. 

Day 5
I’m feeling okay today. 

1.⁠ ⁠I would just improve the cleanliness of the shared spaces because some people don’t treat them very well although this wouldn’t really change my quality of life as I still used the kitchen and bathroom as usual. I think there’s not a lot I would change, I didn’t have many problems 
2.⁠ ⁠My ideal living space would be a studio I suppose, much more comfortable and no stress. Shared housing feels like you’re always holding out until one day you become rich enough to get out.


1.⁠ ⁠I tried to leave that house after the first month and a half because I couldn’t stand my roommate but she refused to move and I paid all of the deposit myself so I couldn’t leave her there in case she ruined the place. I think living in a normal situation in shared housing would be fine with me as long as the other people are clean and respectful, even better if they’re fun to hang out with. Where I will live long term is too difficult to pin point right now because I’m graduating university and will be out of London for the summer. When I come back I will find another temporary place for a year and the same after that year so it’s hard to say. 
2.⁠ ⁠⁠Realistically my future long term place after graduating would be a shared home but I think the most important thing for me is cost. Distance doesn’t worry me as I enjoy commuting as long as I can save money and don’t find it a hassle since I usually study or read at that time. Size and community is not so much an issue too as long as I have my own space that’s fine with me. I’m usually not in my room much at all. Having a nice community within the household would be ideal but not essential. 
3.⁠ ⁠⁠My steps to achieve my ideal home would first be to graduate and find a good paying job! I don’t have any specific goals yet though. 
I love soft yellow lighting! My old flat had one of these big lights and it made the kitchen feel very cosy. If a future living space of mine had this in the communal area I think it would be much nicer. I’m not really sure what promotes a good sense of community or positive social interactions. I think it will just depend on the people you meet.

1.	Changes to the house, most important to least important:
A bigger kitchen would help make that space more sociable. If it was large enough that two people could cook at the same time, I'm sure my housemates and I would talk more.
If the garden was a nicer space and our landlady cleaned up the junk she stores there, then we could use it as a social space and perhaps have barbecues etc.
I would say that a living room would be nice, but ultimately I don't even know if we would use it. It's not as if having a living room would make us more sociable.
1.	My house right now does not at all align with my ideal living space. I would much prefer to not have housemates, and to instead live with only my partner. I have been living in shared houses for so long what my tolerance for this way of living is really low. I am tired of the same issues over and over with housemates. I would like to have a separate room to relax in - ideally a large living room & kitchen space, which is also big enough to have friends over. And not having to check with housemates whether I can have people over would be great. I would also prefer my office space be a different room to the bedroom so I can separate work from any other space.
Pt2
1.	I absolutely do not want to live here long term. This house has always seemed temporary to me. I would like to move with my partner into a house where we can feel like we have a more permanent home, and not like I'm constantly on the move, trapped in an endless cycle of paying extortionate rents for frankly inadequate housing full of people I don't want to see.
2.	Ideal house;
•	A large living-kitchen room with great light where we can socialise when we invite people over
•	A large and quiet office space, and a place to display all my books. Somewhere that gives me easy access to my cameras and any equipment needed for work.
•	A garden big enough for a dog
•	A location where I can get into central London within an hour, for work
•	Close to my friends and family in London
•	Close to nice walks and parks
1.	My partner and I are moving to a new flat, where we won't have to deal with housemates, and can start to move towards these shared house goals. Saving money is key, and we can move to a new place perhaps when we have enough money to buy somewhere - we don't want to rent forever.","Day one

And not having to check with housemates whether I can have people over would be great. I would also prefer my office space be a different room to the bedroom so I can separate work from any other space.
Pt2
1.	I absolutely do not want to live here long term. This house has always seemed temporary to me. I would like to move with my partner into a house where we can feel like we have a more permanent home, and not like I'm constantly on the move, trapped in an endless cycle of paying extortionate rents for frankly inadequate housing full of people I don't want to see.
2.	Ideal house;
•	A large living-kitchen room with great light where we can socialise when we invite people over
•	A large and quiet office space, and a place to display all my books. Somewhere that gives me easy access to my cameras and any equipment needed for work.
•	A garden big enough for a dog
•	A location where I can get into central London within an hour, for work
•	Close to my friends and family in London
•	Close to nice walks and parks
1.	My partner and I are moving to a new flat, where we won't have to deal with housemates, and can start to move towards these shared house goals. Saving money is key, and we can move to a new place perhaps when we have enough money to buy somewhere - we don't want to rent forever.","['day', 'one', '29', 'cornwall', 'england', 'work', 'film',

I live with my boyfriend so I don’t think it’s as much of a sharing situation but again in my previous space there was a time of the beginning when we all tried to be friends and we both barbecue and we had all had a picnic in our garden together.

I was very frustrated with my previous housing situation and also it was far away from the city centre. It was like a 20 minute walk away from the tube. The landlord kept raising prices and like I said the kitchen was clogged and the whole sink stopped working in the kitchen and we had no way of cooking around for three days except with microwave.

We thought that they ordered quite a lot of takeout and they threw them out with takeout boxes because once a month we had to stock up and buy 20 pieces set and will be gone by the end of the month, so we started locking in the cutlery in our cupboard and they also were stealing them from our cupboard so that wasn’t exactly nice.

I think the overall atmosphere and communication it’s really lovely, since there’s not a lot of us and we knew each other before. I am the only person that usually has a problem with something, with like organisation or cleaning or something like that. I just say it, and we just keep each other updated","When it comes to our shared spaces we’d change the kitchen and living room furniture and get more storage space. Most of stuff we have now has been leftover by our friends and we’re slowly changing/adding pieces that more suit our lifestyle and change the space to what we’d need it to be. 
I’d say that my current home mostly align with my vision of an ideal living space. It could be more open but we have a lot of shared space to rest it’s not just everything turned into a bedroom to maximise landlords profit. There’s a lot of light in the flat and it’s in a really good condition (especially plumbing, electric, and general construction wise).

We have an array of lovely shops and places to eat at at hand, plenty greenery, library, gym, things to do within walkable distance. Except for some issues in the building itself and small mould appearances in the bathroom I can absolutely imagine it as my ideal long term home. I definitely plan to stay at my current home long time. Mostly it’s due to all positives listed above and very friendly rent.
When it comes to my ideal home location is very important to me and community - what and who I’d have around me. I don’t care much about size as long as it’s well kept. Having a garden or some green space is really important for me too. And owning it. I do not want my forever home to be possessed by someone else.
So far the only thing I have done so far to come closer to achieving my ideal home is save/invest to have money for it.

participant 8,no,"I am 21. Grew up in Fife, Scotland on the coast. I am currently a student and also work at a small cordial company. I live in London for university. I live in a small student accommodation in Bethnal Green, East London. I have 3 flatmates and live in the smallest/cheapest room available to rent. There are about 60 flats in total but each flat is separated from the other unlike other accommodations I have been to. I pay about £680 a month. Unfortunately the only communal space available is our kitchen which, although a very nice kitchen with everything I need to make nice meals, is quite small and definitely isn’t ideal for having people round.","I like my home now, but starting to feel as though I’ve been here a little too long. I need somewhere I can sit and relax that isn’t my room, basically a sofa in a sitting room. The main difference is at my childhood home I had a lot more room and a lot more opportunity to change up the scene. Growing up we never spent time in our rooms really apart from sleeping, so it is weird adjusting to sleep and relax space being the same.
5 rules - I can’t really think of any rules we have established beyond just keeping a good standard of cleanliness.","Fortunately I’ve never been brought to tears by my accommodation. 
Coming back at the end of a day and chatting away to Clarissa.
It was the most cost effective option for student accommodation available near my uni.
I think before I moved in I was worried that people would be bothered by my cooking habits. I’m not unclean but I like leaving all my seasonings out as it saves me having to reach into the cupboard to find exactly what I need. Fortunately nobody is bothered but that is the most uncomfortable I’ve felt.","Woke up, sat in bed for 30 mins. Went out to get breakfast and do some work in a cafe nearby. Came back for lunch, watched some YouTube videos for a bit then head to the park as was sunny. Worked for a couple hours, then home to cook dinner and chatted to my flatmate for a bit. Watched some telly, then headed to bed.
I spend about 20-30 mins average a day with flatmates.

I am 21. Grew up in Fife, Scotland on the coast. I am currently a student and also work at a small cordial company. I live in London for university. I live in a small student accommodation in Bethnal Green, East London. I have 3 flatmates and live in the smallest/cheapest room available to rent. There are about 60 flats in total but each flat is separated from the other unlike other accommodations I have been to. I pay about £680 a month. Unfortunately the only communal space available is our kitchen which, although a very nice kitchen with everything I need to make nice meals, is quite small and definitely isn’t ideal for having people round.

Day 2

I like my home now, but starting to feel as though I’ve been here a little too long. I need somewhere I can sit and relax that isn’t my room, basically a sofa in a sitting room. The main difference is at my childhood home I had a lot more room and a lot more opportunity to change up the scene. Growing up we never spent time in our rooms really apart from sleeping, so it is weird adjusting to sleep and relax space being the same.
5 rules - I can’t really think of any rules we have established beyond just keeping a good standard of cleanliness.

Day 3

I am feeling fantastic, the sun is out! 

Fortunately I’ve never been brought to tears by my accommodation. 
Coming back at the end of a day and chatting away to Clarissa.
It was the most cost effective option for student accommodation available near my uni.
I think before I moved in I was worried that people would be bothered by my cooking habits. I’m not unclean but I like leaving all my seasonings out as it saves me having to reach into the cupboard to find exactly what I need. Fortunately nobody is bothered but that is the most uncomfortable I’ve felt.

Day 4

Woke up, sat in bed for 30 mins. Went out to get breakfast and do some work in a cafe nearby. Came back for lunch, watched some YouTube videos for a bit then head to the park as was sunny. Worked for a couple hours, then home to cook dinner and chatted to my flatmate for a bit. Watched some telly, then headed to bed.
I spend about 20-30 mins average a day with flatmates.

4.⁠ ⁠⁠I live in London because it’s where me and my partner work, primarily

I live in a borough of West London. It’s me and my partner living together, just the two of us. It’s a one bed, one living room flat, so not massive. It’s about £980 a month, which we split. The living room is our only communal space as we are on the second floor of a multi-flat house. 
This is my side of the bed - it’s the room I sleep in but I share the room so this is really the only part that is “my room”. Non-direct light is important to me because overhead lighting stresses me out. We both use these little stools as night stands. We’re yet to put any art on the walls as I only moved in a few months ago, so that’s something I would change. We didn’t get our bed from ikea and it’s probably my favourite part of the room. 
This is our shared living room. I like the bookshelves and how the light comes in in the evening in the summer. My partner is artistic, and we paint without covering the cheap table underneath it, so it’s covered in splotches and scuffs. If I could change one thing in the room, I’d probably take out that stupid light in the top left corner which is both hard to dress in a lampshade because of where it is, but also why did they put it there in the first place? Having said that, it’s the light I use most in there because it’s cozy in the evenings. ","The flat is too small overall but fine for now. I need a dedicated working space. We don’t have a tv because the space (“LR”) doesn’t work with one, which is fine for now but will change when we inevitably move. My childhood home was much bigger and we had a garden. I do like how it is all one floor. I do the washing up because I am better at it, as well as the hoovering. My partner does the surfaces as she has more patience for it. We both do the laundry. The clothes horse cannot be left up. These are rules because they keep the bits we care about most in terms of cleanliness done.

1. I actually so rarely cry that I’m yet to have cried here.
2. ⁠Me and my partner began a rare tradition of making “beige tapas” for dinner which involves getting around 5 ready meals from tesco and making them all at once. We really laughed the first time.
3. ⁠My partner rented first and I visited for a while before finally moving here last year.
4. ⁠I’m very intolerant of bugs. Recently, despite being on the second floor, we had an ant infestation. I’m really bad at dealing with them, because they’re a persistent pest. Knowing they’re in the house, I found it difficult to sleep. I haven’t seen them for a few days now but every now and then I’ll see just one - which tells me they’ve not truly gone.
This jug is special because I stole it from a project thinking it would be of my partner’s tastes and it was - one of the first times I had gotten something like that, and we bring it out as our dedicated water jug.

2. ⁠We like to watch shows together. My health’s not been brilliant so we’ve not been going out as much as we used to.
3. ⁠Love the atmosphere of the house. We get along very well and communicate if there are any problems with the way we’re living together.

It’s easier to keep track of it and do it when required. I am logical on these specific things as clothes - and how and when we use them - are my own business.

1. I would add a dishwasher if I could. So much time is spent washing dishes and the kitchen is the main focal point for cleaning. I took having a dishwasher at my parents’ house for granted and now I miss it. As dishwashers save energy and clean better than either of us can, it would be great for those reasons too. In last place, we would get a television. Too much time spent watching things on laptops and not looking straight ahead. But the space is too small for one right now and it’s not the right time.
2. ⁠It’s close to it. It doesn’t feel like a student house, which is very important to me. The main thing it lacks is space. I need an office. I would prefer we have two bathrooms because of my medical conditions. But for now, it’s nice.
3. ⁠We’re going to live here until the lease is up and then look at buying a house. They keep raising the prices for rent and it’s not really tied to anything sensical. I want to exit that system.
4. ⁠I want to be within reasonable walking distance to the closest tube/train station. Good public transport links mean everything to me. I want two bathrooms, two living rooms, and an office for my work, and as a place I can game. I would like a garden to plant wild flowers in and to do quick and easy laundry in the summer. And that’s probably in order of importance.
5. ⁠Because of house prices we’re looking to move as soon as possible. We’re wasting time renting. So, in 2025, we’ve got to get onto the housing ladder or risk falling behind. My work is lumpy - that is, unpredictable, but occasionally well paid - and if 2024 is a good year on that front then we’ll be able to get a house quite easily.

The record player as a centrepiece represents the sort of shared living space that me and my partner want. I miss having a television but it would be better suited to a different space, for a different purpose like that. This way, the living space feels more like a place geared for cozy interactions.

2. ⁠I am from Reading/Berkshire

4. ⁠I live in London because it feels like the right place to be. I moved after graduation for work and never left! While I’m young I want to live the city life for as long as I can! 

Where I live:

I live in a funky and unique three-bed house a short walk from Shepherds Bush Station. I live there with my partner, Jen. I don’t pay rent, only bills as Jen owns the house. We have a living room as part of an open plan downstairs including the kitchen and the dining room. We also have a roof terrace. 
In the photos I sent, I see my regular surroundings, I’m here all the time! I would change it to be tidier, but it’s usually very tidy so I don’t really care about a bit of temporary mess.

Something I see is the lack of curtains behind the bed. This is something I would not change. This is something old me would have had a seizure over as I used to need blackout curtains to sleep, but since meeting Jen I have slowly acclimated to sleeping with no curtains at all. I like that, it feels like personal growth!","I  very much like my home! It’s far more open plan than my childhood home and more modern.

Looking at the photos, I took them as the most obvious things that came to mind. My life feels a bit sad, I’m in a cycle of work and entertainment ","Today I am feeling tired, down, stagnant, and my I can’t get my temperature right which is super annoying. 

2. When living in a shared home with my friends, we once all obnoxiously pretended to all be on work calls using our laptops, cushions and other miscellaneous items as “phones” to bother our friend Ross who was actually on a work call in the room.

Something that holds significant memories for me is this photo was taken downstream from a waterfall in Sao Miguel, it was a lovely experience skinny dipping with Jen. Three French people - two girls and guy - joined us in this little natural pool, also naked. It was a fascinating and surreal fun experience and the photos we took there were great!
It makes a nice piece of wall art, but it’s also a nice memory. My first nudist-y experience. I helped the first French girl (who was naked) climb across some rocks to get to the natural pool we were in as the rocks were a bit treacherous. I offered her help and held her hand as we crossed the rocks. She said in a French accent “thank you, naked stranger”, and it was a pretty funny moment. 

Things I would like to remove or replace: This tree is dying, it’s dropping leaves all over the place which I don’t like. Jen’s mess haha. I don’t like living in a space where clothes are on the floor or piling up.
The things I want to remove or replace aren’t particularly deep or special. I don’t have many thoughts of how I want the house to be, I just want things to be tidy!
I don’t feel much of a connection with the house, mainly because I don’t have much money. If I had more money then I would be far more involved with jazzing it up, printing more of my photography and creating a very arty space, but I’m not in the position to do that right now","My day so far has been productive. I went for a walk, got a coffees for myself and my partner, worked with James for a couple of hours (while pacing around the room the entire time, burned 300+ calories) and made a good amount of progress with the film we’re working on at the moment. Cooked lunch for myself and my partner, and now I’m waiting to continue working once James is ready.

Interactions with housemates:
1. I typically spend 6ish hours per day with my housemate (my partner) 
2. ⁠We engage in regular activities and routines together every day
3. ⁠The atmosphere and communication between us is very good. We are every open. We let each other know if something is bothering us and point out positive things regularly.

1: Desired changes:
- It would be nice to have a heater for the roof terrace
- ⁠The roof terrace needs to be cleaned and the plants need a bit of extra love 
- I’d love to have a soundbar for the tv, this is a very unimportant change 

To be honest, in terms of ranking, the soundbar is the most important one to me as that’s where we spend the most time watching movies. The roof terrace is a nice space, but it’s England so we never spend any time out there. 

I’m very happy with my living situation, my quality of life is excellent, so any changes I desire are entirely superficial. 

2: Ideal living space 

My current home is pretty perfect in my opinion, it definitely aligns with my vision of an ideal living space. There’s nothing that doesn’t work for me. A large sofa and large TV, great spaces for entertaining and playing games with friends, I’m very happy. 

Long term housing plans:

1: I plan to live in my current home long term. It’s where I live with my partner, and we plan to stay here for many more years. It’s an ideal home! 

2: Ideal home:

The amenities or things in the house is the most important aspect to me, ie a TV and good living/socialising area. 

The location is the second most important part to me. I like living close to a tube station and not being too far out of the city centre. 

Size is the next most important aspect to me, I’m not too fussed about this. Having a big house is nice, but I’d rather a nice modest sized house in a good location than a big house that’s far away from everything. 

Community is the least important aspect. This will change once I have children, but right now I am not too bothered by this.","Day 1

participant 11,no,"1. age:23
2. I am from Dinnington, Somerset, UK
3. I study interdisciplinary problems and methods at the london interdisciplinary school
4. By necessity of being a student

I have three housemates one of which is my girlfriend.

We have no living room or garden. There is a courtyard outside
or we can chat in staircases with our neighbours. The
courtyard is completely paved over. There are no trees, just
tiny plant pots with no flowers in them.
 


what would I change?
Double bed!
More space
More windows
A fan. Air conditioning would make the room too dry
Sofa in the kitchen
New flatmates (chattier ones)
The kettle, though I am moving out of here in five weeks
there is no excuse for not buying a good one next year
The borough that the house is in
Kitchen on the ground floor where people can knock on the 
windows as they walk past and say hello.


what would I not change
The size of the kitchen
Cupboard space
Lack of usage of said cupboard space by flatmates (all mine!)
Living with my girlfriend (though I can't say how she
feels about this)
the hob and oven are excellent
the insurance on applicances (see how new the hob is? Got replaced yesterday at no charge to me)

The rest of these aren't captured in these photos in particular, but I think are relevant...

Better sound insulation 
Neighbours who don't smoke out the window
How far away from university it is
The floor. I like the bedroom being upstairs
How dark and cozy the room gets at night

what does it tell me about my life?

transient
Little sense of connection to the area or other people
Room is somewhere to escape from or sleep in
Lonely. Hoping for interactions with nice strangers but
wary of nutjobs. 

The window pane to the right is my neighbour's room. ","There are no house rules and no cleaning rota. There are no social spaces (no highlights), we never interact with flatmates. 
For photos that represent me, the one of in progress cooking from yesterday is very representative. 
Computer -something I spend too much time on, for work and play. Book collection - all I see are gaps, but next to one another (book and computer) are routes to my salvation and my doom, respectively. 
I would rather the computer didn't exist or at least wasn't such a s necessity, but it is a tempting portal out of my room and out of London more generally","A time when living in shared housing brought you to tears


I haven't thankfully been brought to tears in shared housing, but a flatmate of mine did not fare so well. Him (X) and I both lived with someone (Y) who I thought was cruel and manipulative, where he would spread false rumours. X would break down at odd times throughout the day, and although it was an odd hour he would cry so loudly you could hear it from every room.
After a while, instead of consoling him people would complain about the noise. 


A moment feeling happy

In this same house (of 7) as the first anecdote, I would love it when another flatmate (C) would invite people around. He was gregarious and new people from all different walks of life. He what I saw as a very European attitude to treating his guests - we would all drink, but sensibly, and we would always make food. Other people hated how there was no prior communication and people would just turn up. Having a big kitchen, living room, and garden was essential to this. I still had the sanctuary of my room to go to if I felt tired. The kitchen was so big I could do my cooking alongside theirs.

How did you come across your shared housing situation. 

I live in the same block of flats as I did last year, where there is an option to re-apply each year. You can state preferences of people you would like to be housed with, but the situation is that we have thousands of people applying to hundreds of rooms managed by one landlord, AA4S. It's like living in private university halls, but instead of corridors you are housed in flats of 4 to 6. I applied with my girlfriend and left it up to chance who the other two flatmates would be. 


An item that holds significant memories for you

This beautiful cajon was bought between our housemates in my first year of university towards the end of when we lived together. At the end our all-too-frequent COVID house parties, a group of us would generally end up drumming on whatever we could find - actual instruments, but also chairs, colanders, cooking chopsticks etc. It was magical. Eventually we got a bit more professional and bought some bongos, and cajons made of cardboard. Just before we left we invested in this more professional cajon, but as you can see from the label it has barely got any use in any of the houses I’ve been in since. It hasn’t been the right time, place, or group of people. An item that brings up memories to cherish.",0,"
The most significant change I could see is simply the additional of some sofas in our kitchen (with enough space left to still move around). In another flat in my block they have taken some sofas off the street and it has completely changed the dynamic of the space. Something comfortable to sit down in or sleep on makes such a difference. The space is so much more inviting. I wish the kitchen was ever so slightly bigger so that we could squeeze one in, and that the doorframes and corridors were a little wider so we could get the thing in and through the doors.

The second thing I would do is make communal spaces greener. The only communal spaces in my housing block are grey and covered in concrete. I can’t stress how lovely a garden is as something soft and earthy to lie down on, even if it’s just grass. This is a big hypothetical change, and I think is slightly less significant as I can’t imagine using it as much as a sofa. 

The third would be some less harsh lighting for the kitchen, so it looks less sterile. Tacky as it might be, putting up some Chinese lanterns would be great. I love the idea of adding both something to soften the mood, and something that looks like people have tried to claim the space and put some culture in to it. A flat I visit from time to time has Chinese new year stickers up everywhere and it always lifts my mood to see them. They’ve stuck good luck signs on their doors. It’s added such a sense of camaraderie, like they’re all creating the space together.



2. my current home is far from ideal. My bedroom is a nice sanctuary, but this year I haven’t done much to claim it as mine. The kitchen is like no-mans land, full of cooking stuff but nobody has left their mark there beyond cooking appliances left out. I want people to fill the space with their personalities. 


Long term plans

1.	My contract for this place ends in a few weeks. I’m glad about that, as I’d like to move on and try again someplace else, with more people I would rather with live with (my girlfriend of course being the exception!). Given the right bunch (as I’ve had in the past), I would want to really push the boat out and co-create the space that we want to live in, but with our flatmates it feels like a Sisyphean effort. They just don’t budge. I’m sure with enough effort I could have done something, but have been preoccupied with university commitments this year. I am feeling enthusiastic about giving it a better go and making where I next with feel more like a temporary home.

2.	My ideal home is leafy, green, rural, and most importantly of all, has enough space to be absolutely full of books. It’s surrounded by trees and you would access it by car, bike, or whatever crazy individual transport the future will dream up. I want it to be a detached house, home to maybe big extended family with plenty of guest rooms for people to stay as long as they like. People drop in and out but there are very often people stopping by. I don’t mind if the place is an absolute mess as long as it’s not dirty. Being filled with trinkets and other bits will add character. A big kitchen where plenty of people can cook together is a must. Some kind of intermediate between house and the outdoors is strongly desired, like a conservatory, pavilion, or balcony. I imagine it to be the perfect place to raise ‘free range’ children. Like a hobbit hole that outgrew its hillock and kept rising. I would try my best to tend to a garden, but I can’t promise much. A more general point here is that this is maybe the property I’d want to raise my children in. In later life, say, I’d like to live on the fifth floor in some smoky flat somewhere like Ljubljana. One giant study. From here I can live out the dream life as the cantankerous old professorial type where young cocky fools can debate the old man. Of great concern is what kind of place I’d like to live in before these examples. I have little clue and it causes me distress to a) not think I have much choice in the matter, and will follow whatever is affordable, and b) that I should probably be bracing myself for somewhere pretty grim. 


3.	I believe that such a house like this already exists. I have visited some like it and there are a few of them about, here in the UK or elsewhere. There might even be one in London, but I expect that such a place will be so coveted that everyone will know who lives there. I’d rather be somewhere more remote and hence more private, and more within budget.

As in, this photo was sitting in my library when me and a friend of my were discussing a while ago this idea of what sort of things housing in London is missing. ","Day 1 
1. age:23
2. I am from Dinnington, Somerset, UK
3. I study interdisciplinary problems and methods at the london interdisciplinary school
4. By necessity of being a student

I have three housemates one of which is my girlfriend.

We have no living room or garden. There is a courtyard outside
or we can chat in staircases with our neighbours. The
courtyard is completely paved over. There are no trees, just
tiny plant pots with no flowers in them.
 


what would I change?
Double bed!
More space
More windows
A fan. Air conditioning would make the room too dry
Sofa in the kitchen
New flatmates (chattier ones)
The kettle, though I am moving out of here in five weeks
there is no excuse for not buying a good one next year
The borough that the house is in
Kitchen on the ground floor where people can knock on the 
windows as they walk past and say hello.


what would I not change
The size of the kitchen
Cupboard space
Lack of usage of said cupboard space by flatmates (all mine!)
Living with my girlfriend (though I can't say how she
feels about this)
the hob and oven are excellent
the insurance on applicances (see how new the hob is? Got replaced yesterday at no charge to me)

The rest of these aren't captured in these photos in particular, but I think are relevant...

Better sound insulation 
Neighbours who don't smoke out the window
How far away from university it is
The floor. I like the bedroom being upstairs
How dark and cozy the room gets at night

what does it tell me about my life?

transient
Little sense of connection to the area or other people
Room is somewhere to escape from or sleep in
Lonely. Hoping for interactions with nice strangers but
wary of nutjobs. 

The window pane to the right is my neighbour's room. 

Day 2. 

There are no house rules and no cleaning rota. There are no social spaces (no highlights), we never interact with flatmates. 
For photos that represent me, the one of in progress cooking from yesterday is very representative. 
Computer -something I spend too much time on, for work and play. Book collection - all I see are gaps, but next to one another (book and computer) are routes to my salvation and my doom, respectively. 
I would rather the computer didn't exist or at least wasn't such a s necessity, but it is a tempting portal out of my room and out of London more generally

Day 3. 

A time when living in shared housing brought you to tears


I haven't thankfully been brought to tears in shared housing, but a flatmate of mine did not fare so well. Him (X) and I both lived with someone (Y) who I thought was cruel and manipulative, where he would spread false rumours. X would break down at odd times throughout the day, and although it was an odd hour he would cry so loudly you could hear it from every room.
After a while, instead of consoling him people would complain about the noise. 


A moment feeling happy

In this same house (of 7) as the first anecdote, I would love it when another flatmate (C) would invite people around. He was gregarious and new people from all different walks of life. He what I saw as a very European attitude to treating his guests - we would all drink, but sensibly, and we would always make food. Other people hated how there was no prior communication and people would just turn up. Having a big kitchen, living room, and garden was essential to this. I still had the sanctuary of my room to go to if I felt tired. The kitchen was so big I could do my cooking alongside theirs.

How did you come across your shared housing situation. 

I live in the same block of flats as I did last year, where there is an option to re-apply each year. You can state preferences of people you would like to be housed with, but the situation is that we have thousands of people applying to hundreds of rooms managed by one landlord, AA4S. It's like living in private university halls, but instead of corridors you are housed in flats of 4 to 6. I applied with my girlfriend and left it up to chance who the other two flatmates would be. 


An item that holds significant memories for you

This beautiful cajon was bought between our housemates in my first year of university towards the end of when we lived together. At the end our all-too-frequent COVID house parties, a group of us would generally end up drumming on whatever we could find - actual instruments, but also chairs, colanders, cooking chopsticks etc. It was magical. Eventually we got a bit more professional and bought some bongos, and cajons made of cardboard. Just before we left we invested in this more professional cajon, but as you can see from the label it has barely got any use in any of the houses I’ve been in since. It hasn’t been the right time, place, or group of people. An item that brings up memories to cherish.


Day 5 
1.	
The most significant change I could see is simply the additional of some sofas in our kitchen (with enough space left to still move around). In another flat in my block they have taken some sofas off the street and it has completely changed the dynamic of the space. Something comfortable to sit down in or sleep on makes such a difference. The space is so much more inviting. I wish the kitchen was ever so slightly bigger so that we could squeeze one in, and that the doorframes and corridors were a little wider so we could get the thing in and through the doors.

The second thing I would do is make communal spaces greener. The only communal spaces in my housing block are grey and covered in concrete. I can’t stress how lovely a garden is as something soft and earthy to lie down on, even if it’s just grass. This is a big hypothetical change, and I think is slightly less significant as I can’t imagine using it as much as a sofa. 

The third would be some less harsh lighting for the kitchen, so it looks less sterile. Tacky as it might be, putting up some Chinese lanterns would be great. I love the idea of adding both something to soften the mood, and something that looks like people have tried to claim the space and put some culture in to it. A flat I visit from time to time has Chinese new year stickers up everywhere and it always lifts my mood to see them. They’ve stuck good luck signs on their doors. It’s added such a sense of camaraderie, like they’re all creating the space together.



2. my current home is far from ideal. My bedroom is a nice sanctuary, but this year I haven’t done much to claim it as mine. The kitchen is like no-mans land, full of cooking stuff but nobody has left their mark there beyond cooking appliances left out. I want people to fill the space with their personalities. 


Long term plans

1.	My contract for this place ends in a few weeks. I’m glad about that, as I’d like to move on and try again someplace else, with more people I would rather with live with (my girlfriend of course being the exception!). Given the right bunch (as I’ve had in the past), I would want to really push the boat out and co-create the space that we want to live in, but with our flatmates it feels like a Sisyphean effort. They just don’t budge. I’m sure with enough effort I could have done something, but have been preoccupied with university commitments this year. I am feeling enthusiastic about giving it a better go and making where I next with feel more like a temporary home.

2.	My ideal home is leafy, green, rural, and most importantly of all, has enough space to be absolutely full of books. It’s surrounded by trees and you would access it by car, bike, or whatever crazy individual transport the future will dream up. I want it to be a detached house, home to maybe big extended family with plenty of guest rooms for people to stay as long as they like. People drop in and out but there are very often people stopping by. I don’t mind if the place is an absolute mess as long as it’s not dirty. Being filled with trinkets and other bits will add character. A big kitchen where plenty of people can cook together is a must. Some kind of intermediate between house and the outdoors is strongly desired, like a conservatory, pavilion, or balcony. I imagine it to be the perfect place to raise ‘free range’ children. Like a hobbit hole that outgrew its hillock and kept rising. I would try my best to tend to a garden, but I can’t promise much. A more general point here is that this is maybe the property I’d want to raise my children in. In later life, say, I’d like to live on the fifth floor in some smoky flat somewhere like Ljubljana. One giant study. From here I can live out the dream life as the cantankerous old professorial type where young cocky fools can debate the old man. Of great concern is what kind of place I’d like to live in before these examples. I have little clue and it causes me distress to a) not think I have much choice in the matter, and will follow whatever is affordable, and b) that I should probably be bracing myself for somewhere pretty grim. 


3.	I believe that such a house like this already exists. I have visited some like it and there are a few of them about, here in the UK or elsewhere. There might even be one in London, but I expect that such a place will be so coveted that everyone will know who lives there. I’d rather be somewhere more remote and hence more private, and more within budget. I could very well end up in one halfway across the world, though I would hate for it (and me) to be a little bastion of Englishness in a foreign land, like a governor and his residence. In truth community is not so important, friends can come visit! As to how I am going to get there, a good salary would certainly help.

participant 12,no,"I am 21 years old. I am from the outskirts of London that’s where I grew up Essex and I am 
I am currently an undergraduate student so I get money from the government and I live in London because I’m a student. 
The house is in west London, near earl court station. It looks out onto cemetery with eight people it’s a very big Victorian terrace house with four floors five floors. It’s pretty big people live there with two bathrooms and it’s all rent out with students around £780 in terms of communal spaces. We have a kitchen we don’t have a living room. I’m technically under the property there are balconies under the gardens but they are all prevented from accessing unfortunately the garden door is locked And the doors to get onto the balcony are locked also to prevent the student in a nice residential with nice people, but he’s a bit annoying so I have done is go out outside the windows to get access to the garden and the balconies through the attic ceiling to get on the rooftop. that is not allowed but we but we feel that the only place we could talk was the kitchen.

I also think it’s important to mention that the kitchen is not big enough for the amount of people that live in the house with one hob and four chairs so there are enough chairs for everyone that lives there and it gets very messy. It hasn’t been renovated in while. But also because they’re not maintaining the product very well it could do with a lot of changing surfaces fixing cracks on the walls. This is from the day one prompt the common room. I see a space that we have kind of made together and bought stuff in, but also very messy space with not enough space for all the people living there. Not enough space to put all our belongings, like pot and pans and bits. What I would change is the space, and what I would not change it’s the collective matarte of it. Tell maybe curious bunch of people live there with all the stuff that’s in there and we use it quite a lot express ourselves I guess.
It’s a with my room it’s a platform type of sleeping situation as it feels like kind of the separation with like your living space and sleeping space change I would change the floors are very old and holy and I would change the smell of the sink because it has a selfish smell And would not change that. I really love the height and the size. It’s quite small. Tell me about my life. Is the plants in there tells you that nature is important yoga mat shows the tie and it’s quite a space that I used to store all the things I’m interested in all the stuff that I like sleeping space it is double bed very comfortable not much there I quite like it. It would be nice if there was a bit more space above so I can stand up. That’s the nature of the mezzanine room, I tell you about my life. I enjoy a nice place to sleep maybe. ","You’re home and your childhood what do I think about my home? Are there any differences between your home now and your home in your childhood? I think the house I live now is pretty big with lots of rooms and lots of space individually rented out space collective space like it was in my childhood home , it feels much more you can go you can’t go Homie it’s not bigger than the house. I grew up in the fact that there is no access to the garden. No access to the garden makes it quite different to in terms of the written rules that the landlord gave us like don’t make too much noise, certain times don’t play instruments in your room which are quite strict I think. The bizarre rules that they have but they gave us no contract where we’re not allowed to use the common areas of 10 pm and no washing machines after 10 pm no overnight guests anyone in unless you know them some are very strange rules that nobody follows because they are a bit bizarre like the ones where we can’t use the common areas or the washing machine Guests and we did ask the landlord up with that and they like it’s fine just as long as they’re not living here long-term but the contractors say no in terms of the people within the house we’ve had a bit of rules within the kitchen and keeping it clean and no coffee ground in the sink wipe off oil from trays blah blah blah blah blah blah keep it cleanjust like unwritten rules be kind to the space that everybody lives within and don’t make too much noise. ","How am I feeling today? A bit bit down but getting a bit better. Share memorable story from your shared housing experience. 
I’m a time and something has brought me to tears, so I have been keeping caterpillars in the kitchen and raising them into moths and that brought me to tears and the collective the collective investment we had as as a house with his caterpillars made it so meaningful
A moment that has made me laugh, I guess I think just the communal dinners that we have and the people that we invite really creates a nice atmosphere of happiness and people laugh and people make good food and share how they’re feeling and all that kind of stuff how did you come across current through spare room luckily after a month of searching a full-time searching.
The landlord come in as uncomfortable the landlord do come in without telling us is not into our private room to the shed in areas like the kitchen and corridors so whatever uncomfortable and that’s legal but at one point there was a man shouting at my flat mate shouting at her, but I think that just being very angrily telling her that this is no state of kitchen should be in and what are we doing blah blah blah blah because it was quite messy But they didn’t provide a lot of places to put on so they could’ve been better behaviour on both sides this day. ","How much time do you typically spend with your housemates all week? I would say a decent amount like or maybe more like five hours once or twice a week sometimes sometimes sometimes more sometimes during the morning each other together but that is depending on who the flat is, but I would say quite Today lines and evenings are pretty social with deadlines cause students in the last two years I can get in the way and this weeks go ahead without seeing each other recently it’s been good for your housemates eating dinners and trip sometimes the atmosphere and communication with your shed homeit’s good for the people that socialise the others do not atmosphere. I think it’s quite good between the people that live. There hasn’t been any bad blood spill.","If you could make changes improvements to your current communal spaces at home what would they be? Would they change significantly? Enhance your quality of life and order of impact and explain your reasoning . 
changes? living room living room Air will very significantly in hard quality of life just cause it’s like a little buffer space between the outside and your room that’s not just your isolating and not the kitchen which gets quite messy and as often just not as comfortable and to sit the chair next to a table which feels very you don’t want to come home to that, another team would be approach to the whole situation, more kindness a bit more trust and maybe the absence of bizarre rules which they have given us. A bit of a bit of upkeep - there is  bit of mould in the shower which isn’t great for your health but I would say living room would be really really good and also access to the garden space insane how that would help with your vision of living space my room I love my room it’s sink ceilings big window lots of greenery to see the home is beautiful from the outside has lots of potential but Room is lacking outdoors lacking, and a bit of upkeep
Do you plan to live in your current home long-term? I do not plan to live there long term. I Will not be there next year because I enjoy change. and I think I really want living room so that’s a big factor in that one even though the rent is pretty good here describe your ideal and detail considering aspects such as size amenities and community location North London Green Green space Hampstead Heath regents park something like that or canal send some nature very close by size doesn’t have to be big but amount for some space that isn’t just your room i.e. living room and kitchen maybe even a dining room and community I’d like to be a bunch of people living there not too many though I quite like the size of my one right now in ton of people I know maybe maybe six people are foster community if you have specific goals or steps to achieve if you describe them in detail I can’t think of any specific steps I guess finding homes through people that you know who have lived in them and can say good things about them maybe before that court, because people try to keep hold of good places.

It’s pretty big people live there with two bathrooms and it’s all rent out with students around £780 in terms of communal spaces. We have a kitchen we don’t have a living room. I’m technically under the property there are balconies under the gardens but they are all prevented from accessing unfortunately the garden door is locked And the doors to get onto the balcony are locked also to prevent the student in a nice residential with nice people, but he’s a bit annoying so I have done is go out outside the windows to get access to the garden and the balconies through the attic ceiling to get on the rooftop. that is not allowed but we but we feel that the only place we could talk was the kitchen.

I also think it’s important to mention that the kitchen is not big enough for the amount of people that live in the house with one hob and four chairs so there are enough chairs for everyone that lives there and it gets very messy. It hasn’t been renovated in while. But also because they’re not maintaining the product very well it could do with a lot of changing surfaces fixing cracks on the walls. This is from the day one prompt the common room. I see a space that we have kind of made together and bought stuff in, but also very messy space with not enough space for all the people living there. Not enough space to put all our belongings, like pot and pans and bits. What I would change is the space, and what I would not change it’s the collective matarte of it. Tell maybe curious bunch of people live there with all the stuff that’s in there and we use it quite a lot express ourselves I guess.
It’s a with my room it’s a platform type of sleeping situation as it feels like kind of the separation with like your living space and sleeping space change I would change the floors are very old and holy and I would change the smell of the sink because it has a selfish smell And would not change that. I really love the height and the size. It’s quite small. Tell me about my life. Is the plants in there tells you that nature is important yoga mat shows the tie and it’s quite a space that I used to store all the things I’m interested in all the stuff that I like sleeping space it is double bed very comfortable not much there I quite like it. It would be nice if there was a bit more space above so I can stand up. That’s the nature of the mezzanine room, I tell you about my life. I enjoy a nice place to sleep maybe. 

Day 2 

You’re home and your childhood what do I think about my home? Are there any differences between your home now and your home in your childhood? I think the house I live now is pretty big with lots of rooms and lots of space individually rented out space collective space like it was in my childhood home , it feels much more you can go you can’t go Homie it’s not bigger than the house. I grew up in the fact that there is no access to the garden. No access to the garden makes it quite different to in terms of the written rules that the landlord gave us like don’t make too much noise, certain times don’t play instruments in your room which are quite strict I think. The bizarre rules that they have but they gave us no contract where we’re not allowed to use the common areas of 10 pm and no washing machines after 10 pm no overnight guests anyone in unless you know them some are very strange rules that nobody follows because they are a bit bizarre like the ones where we can’t use the common areas or the washing machine Guests and we did ask the landlord up with that and they like it’s fine just as long as they’re not living here long-term but the contractors say no in terms of the people within the house we’ve had a bit of rules within the kitchen and keeping it clean and no coffee ground in the sink wipe off oil from trays blah blah blah blah blah blah keep it cleanjust like unwritten rules be kind to the space that everybody lives within and don’t make too much noise. 

Day 3 

How am I feeling today? A bit bit down but getting a bit better. Share memorable story from your shared housing experience. 
I’m a time and something has brought me to tears, so I have been keeping caterpillars in the kitchen and raising them into moths and that brought me to tears and the collective the collective investment we had as as a house with his caterpillars made it so meaningful
A moment that has made me laugh, I guess I think just the communal dinners that we have and the people that we invite really creates a nice atmosphere of happiness and people laugh and people make good food and share how they’re feeling and all that kind of stuff how did you come across current through spare room luckily after a month of searching a full-time searching.
The landlord come in as uncomfortable the landlord do come in without telling us is not into our private room to the shed in areas like the kitchen and corridors so whatever uncomfortable and that’s legal but at one point there was a man shouting at my flat mate shouting at her, but I think that just being very angrily telling her that this is no state of kitchen should be in and what are we doing blah blah blah blah because it was quite messy But they didn’t provide a lot of places to put on so they could’ve been better behaviour on both sides this day. 


Day 4. 

How much time do you typically spend with your housemates all week? I would say a decent amount like or maybe more like five hours once or twice a week sometimes sometimes sometimes more sometimes during the morning each other together but that is depending on who the flat is, but I would say quite Today lines and evenings are pretty social with deadlines cause students in the last two years I can get in the way and this weeks go ahead without seeing each other recently it’s been good for your housemates eating dinners and trip sometimes the atmosphere and communication with your shed homeit’s good for the people that socialise the others do not atmosphere. I think it’s quite good between the people that live. There hasn’t been any bad blood spill.





Day 5 

If you could make changes improvements to your current communal spaces at home what would they be? Would they change significantly? Enhance your quality of life and order of impact and explain your reasoning . 
changes? living room living room Air will very significantly in hard quality of life just cause it’s like a little buffer space between the outside and your room that’s not just your isolating and not the kitchen which gets quite messy and as often just not as comfortable and to sit the chair next to a table which feels very you don’t want to come home to that, another team would be approach to the whole situation, more kindness a bit more trust and maybe the absence of bizarre rules which they have given us. A bit of a bit of upkeep - there is  bit of mould in the shower which isn’t great for your health but I would say living room would be really really good and also access to the garden space insane how that would help with your vision of living space my room I love my room it’s sink ceilings big window lots of greenery to see the home is beautiful from the outside has lots of potential but Room is lacking outdoors lacking, and a bit of upkeep
Do you plan to live in your current home long-term? I do not plan to live there long term. I Will not be there next year because I enjoy change. and I think I really want living room so that’s a big factor in that one even though the rent is pretty good here describe your ideal and detail considering aspects such as size amenities and community location North London Green Green space Hampstead Heath regents park something like that or canal send some nature very close by size doesn’t have to be big but amount for some space that isn’t just your room i.e. living room and kitchen maybe even a dining room and community I’d like to be a bunch of people living there not too many though I quite like the size of my one right now in ton of people I know maybe maybe six people are foster community if you have specific goals or steps to achieve if you describe them in detail I can’t think of any specific steps I guess finding homes through people that you know who have lived in them and can say good things about them maybe before that court, because people try to keep hold of good places.

1. I’m 20
2. I’m from a town in the countryside in Hertfordshire, close to London
3. I’m a student and I currently don’t work, but I take part time roles 
4. I live in London for university 
5. My accommodation is in Tottenham Hale, it’s managed by Unite Students. There are 700 odd students living here, but I share a flat with 6 other people. We have a communal kitchen between the 7 of us which has a breakfast bar style eating area with stools, and a couple of sofas at the back of the kitchen. In our flat there is no separate living room to the kitchen, it is all one space.  The accomodation has 2 courtyards, one is green with flower beds and benches, and the other is paved with stone slabs. There is also a common room where people can study or play pool/foosball.","1. See photo 
2. See photo (I can’t draw the other social spaces I mentioned such as the courtyard and common room, so just the kitchen)
3. I wish we had a separate living room because no one uses the sofas or sits in the kitchen to socialise. The kitchen feels like a dull and cold place, it’s not inviting. I think this is one of the reasons people in my flat don’t socialise together. However, I use the kitchen a lot because I enjoy cooking and even when I spend a couple of hours in the kitchen, I might not see any of my flatmates. My childhood home is completely different, they’re incomparable. We have lots of shared spaces in my childhood home, a proper living room and an open plan kitchen-dining room. We have doors that open out onto the garden from both the kitchen and the living room which allows the outside in. Our garden is a peaceful place with plenty of furniture to sit outside on nice days and enjoy the fresh air. That’s one of the things I miss the most about being in London.
4. I’m not sure how to answer this question, I don’t feel like we have any rules? None of us really know each other, we’ve never all been in the same room together and we don’t all communicate. We never set up rules and I don’t even feel like there’s many unwritten rules.","
1. Missing home, feeling lonely here. Even though I have 6 flatmates it feels like I have none. I barely see them, I think I’ve been a whole week before without seeing anyone. That feels very lonely, human interaction is important for all of us. I think I had expectations before I moved in that as flatmates we would socialise or at least make an effort to. I realise we don’t have to be really close friends, but just people to talk to at the end of the day. 
2. A situation that made me laugh - I keep a tea towel on the handles of one of my cupboard doors. I always have. One day I noticed that it had moved from its normal home, it was screwed up in a soggy ball on one of the countertops. This was in Feb/March maybe? So I had been living here for quite some time, since September, and no one had ever used my tea towels before (thankfully). I took it as a one of, but then it kept happening again and again. The tea towels would turn up in random places around the kitchen, sometimes soggy, sometimes stained with oil. I couldn’t work out who was using it and what they were using it for, and it really frustrated me. I had to keep changing the tea towel as it was getting dirty more quickly. One day I walked into the kitchen and my flatmate Andrew was in there making some food, with my tea towel in his hand. Now you have to realise that the tea towel thief had been a mystery to me for a month or so, and in that moment, when I caught him red handed with the tea towel in hand, I couldn’t stop smiling. I found it so funny, so comical. After a month of frustration I had solved the mystery and he was completely unbothered. I didn’t say anything to him about it, I didn’t confront him. I just turned away and smiled to myself.","Hahah this is laughable to me, because realistically it’s zero. On the odd occasion I’ll end up in the kitchen at the same time as someone else, but that only ever happens with 2 people and they don’t talk to me. If I’m lucky we exchange a few words, so I wouldn’t call it ‘spending time with them’. 
2. Nope, none. We are all independent, completely disconnected. 
3. The communication is non-existent. There is a group chat that was made by the accommodation provider before we moved in and there was a little bit of chat on that previously. But there’s only ever a message if one of my housemates is locked out. We stay out of each others way, there are a couple of people I haven’t seen in months. Recently, the person I would say I was ‘closest’ too and had the most communication with, moved out without telling anyone. So that sums it up.
