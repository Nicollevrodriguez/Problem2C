6,"Not (currently) a big fan of Corbyn, but what other options do millenials (who are now approaching 40!) have to vote for? The Conservatives have had 10 years in charge, and things have been getting rapidly worse. Capitalism has completely failed those under 40, with the credit crunch, followed by austerity, leaving living standards dropping and a general feeling of 'hopelessness' about the future. I'm nearing 30 now, still renting, facing the very possible reality that I will never be able to afford my own home or children. Can't be surprised when we see a sudden surge of socialism when our current system has failed an entire generation.

1) Millennials don't want defined benefit pensions, they want the freedom to choose how their money is invested even if there is a risk of their investments under performing and them not having enough to retire.

2) Millennials don't want a stable long term job at one company, they want the freedom to move between multiple different jobs constantly obtaining all manner of valuable life experiences.

3) Millennials  don't want want fixed hours they prefer flexible hour or zero hour contracts that give them the freedom and flexibility to work as and when it suits them.

41,"The grouping is fairly-arbitrary.  I'd argue it also varies by country.

My personal take is that Millennials lived through 9/11 and were old enough to understand what it was like before that, and what changed afterwards (anti-war sentiment before and after Afghanistan and Iraq, laws like the PATRIOT act being passed as a consequence, fear, etc.).  Generation Z were born after this, or were too young to understand.

Another way of thinking about it is that while both generations are Internet-savvy, Millennials are more likely to remember things like dial-up, Geocities, MSN and MySpace.  They're thus more likely to understand how the Internet began and thus perhaps be a bit more cautious about things like social media privacy.  Generation Z, on the other hand, grew up with Facebook as ubiquitous as email was to Millennials, and thus their lower-bounds on privacy are...  Facebook.

21 is right on the boundary, possibly too young to understand 9/11 in the same way as an older Millennial would.

I have been banging on about this on here and to people listening to my conspiracy theory. 

It's super odd (and as I have learned you live/lived in Germany), as every else you advertise by square area. In the UK, it can be such a pain to even get the floor area (sometimes won't be listed in a easy to read number, but just the floor plan with some numbers on it). Makes searching for places such a pain. 

IMO, should start pushing our local MP's (clearly the Housing market it self wont' do it)  to make it a requirement to list houses/flats by floor space (and make it filterable and searchable). ",2018-04-26 14:30:39,15,ukpolitics,comment,Millennials don't need living rooms says leading architect

Contrast that with the idea of something more akin to an upgraded hotel room in a residential area. You can have a Murphy bed that hides in the wall, a galley kitchenette, a private bathroom with bath, space for a good size TV and storage and a doorman/reception.

The accommodation is perfect for some people, and can't be complained about it in-and-of itself.

Even if we built 10 million new homes this year and put serious restrictions on who could buy them (e.g. must have right to reside and must not own any other residential properties) and this fixed the housing crisis, I still think choice is a positive and some people who don't feel they need a living room, should have the option to pay less for a property without.",2018-04-26 13:44:58,-2,ukpolitics,comment,Millennials don't need living rooms says leading architect

If she ignores this you can ask her again, and if ignored you can let her know you’ll need to use your heater. Then use the heater.

Unfortunately you can’t control her, so she may just decide to keep being awful. In which case I’d suggest looking for a new flat.

As a last resort, you could offer her £20 a month extra to have the heating set at your desired times/temperature. Of course only do this after seeing the actual cost incurred to her. Something like that, if it’s worth it to you.

Be firm and remind her that you’re paying for rent with bills included, but at the moment you’re so cold that you cannot sleep and are getting ill. You could also get a thermometer and show her how cold it is in your room at night. If you start providing details, numbers and photos, she’ll start to get intimidated by your documentation.

495,"Do some research into your rights as a renter/lodger. There will be legislation attached the temperature especially as your utilities are included with your rent therefore you are not in control and it is a provided service. 

Buy a room thermometer and keep tabs on the actual temperature you’re experiencing.

It sounds like you’ve been very polite if a little meek and indirect discussion with your landlady. It might do you well to be a little less British about the issues and directly explain that you are not happy with the freezing conditions and show her the readings. Know what your rights are so you go into the conversation knowledgeable and forearmed! She may even be understanding and apologise. You don’t have to be rude just direct. If this doesn’t work, present her with the laws and legislation regarding temperature. I’m sure you can find it on the government website.

 I’m surprised by all the comments saying 18c-21c should be maintained as a minimum; my central heating is run off a log burner boiler which is very poor and I’ve gotten used to 9-13c being the norm, if I go into a modern centrally heated house at 21c I just about suffocate!

'economical' is a bit of an oddity when it comes to heating, as they're actually pretty much all 'economical' - the energy turns directly to heat with very little 'waste'.

The 'uneconomical' comes from trying to maintain temperature with poor insulation. 

If you can't modify the structure of your house to be better insulated (although, sometimes that is an option - there's usually places where insulation can be added) then curtains and drapes help. Windows and doorways are usually the biggest heat sinks, so curtaining over them does a lot. And after that, drapes on your walls will trap air and reduce heat losses.

And with that, then all you need is a thermostat, and it'll actually not use a lot of energy overall.",2024-01-21 11:59:44,2,london,comment,Moved into a loft room for 3 months… live in landlady doesn’t put heating on very often

A lot of landlords are truly cosplaying and reenacting some Victorian levels of power over those less fortunate than them, and kick you out as soon as you stop playing ball or essentially being an invisible presence in the house who's paying the rent (their mortgage), but isn't really around as much and doesn't show up in the kitchen, living room etc.

Second thing is, if you're paying £900 for an unheated loft, as the only person living in the house bar the landlady, and unless you have circumstances that prevent you from renting 'properly' (e.g. bad credit rating, no job etc.), I'd seriously start looking around. 

London rents are crazy, but for £900 you **can** find a room that's properly insulated, has bills included and, most importantly, doesn't have a live-in landlord meaning you will be a tenant and have more rights; also: no snooping around the bills and usage, since all the tenants will have reasonable expected usage of utilities, and will be on the hook.

544,"I was talking about the contract situation in general, as this is what a lot of people are confused by - if your contract says you have a ""license"" or any of bizarre wording that employs terms that don't really have a strict, legal definition, but your landlord does not live with you, you're a tenant, end of.

Obviously it's a different ballgame if you don't have the time/money to fight it out (sadly, a lot of people don't - which is another thing landlords exploit, and often), but in pure theory, if your landlord doesn't live with you, you can claw yourself in in case of problems, take the whole thing to court and you **will** win - and there are numerous stories of people having done so, having won 3x deposit if it wasn't put in protection scheme, etc. etc.

In OP's case, if they only can, I'd just look at moving out as the price doesn't seem to correspond to the quality of living, it's not market value especially as a lodger, as the first move. For that kind of money I feel they could still be a tenant somewhere, and have less headache, and improved conditions, too - maybe in a less desirable/central part of London if they're in one of the in-demand parts now, but it still should be doable.

Second move, if they can't move out that is, would be getting an electric heater, yes, although it _is_ risky because with a live-in landlord they are a lodger and the landlord does have a legal right to come in and peek around whether when the lodger is in or not, or use any silly pretext they can come up with - and I bet they won't like seeing electric heaters they haven't been told about, as, by the sound of it, they're quite thrifty and tight-fisted as it is.

Sadly, as a live-in landlord they _can_ do that and kick the OP out at no notice then, and that's another thing that the courts would side with, in general - if you're lodging you should generally know what you're signing up for, and that's having little rights and no safety net. 

Lodging is generally a shit arrangement, probably the only benefit being it can be a bit cheaper than renting as a tenant (but not always, mind), and things like a broken boiler, electricity/gas issues etc. being sorted out rather promptly, because unless the house/flat is built in a very specific way with some kind of a separation of supply networks between their part and your part, all the problems will immediately hit the landlord as well - and they won't want to suffer themselves too much. I think we all know that maintenance repairs can take days, if not weeks, depending on the problem, with independent/private landlords or agencies.

With live-in landlords the vibe is really a lot about what kind of people they are, at the end of the day.

There _are_ those live-in landlords who treat their lodgers with respect, try to become friends with them, and treat them as tenants in all but name - but, sadly, a lot of them are the opposite. 

In OP's case someone who only switches the heating on for 2 hours in the evening in the middle of one of the coldest and harshest winters in recent memory, and doesn't have enough of consideration in them to realise it can be problematic for another person… Well, they're not one of those landlords, sadly, so you can't count on their common sense, good reasoning or sympathy.",2024-01-24 10:09:45,1,london,comment,Moved into a loft room for 3 months… live in landlady doesn’t put heating on very often

553,"Really depends on the size of the space you're heating, how cold it is outside, how much insulation you have (loft rooms are usually not well insulated, I have loft bedrooms in two separate houses and they're always much colder in winter than the rest of the house).

I have a 3 bedroom Victorian House heated using exactly these types of heaters. Compared to gas central heating, the cost of running these things is, like I said, enormous.

It's not 15 minutes and done. It's an hour to bring a room up to temperature if it's not already warm, and then it'll turn itself on and off every 5 to 10 minutes to maintain the temperature, or in other terms it's on about 50% of the time to maintain temperature. So yes, to keep one room warm for just an evening you're looking at £2-£3. Now add the morning to that, and if you're at home it'll be on and off through the afternoon too. Now add the concept of having other rooms in your house and wanting them to be at least 16C rather than 8C, so add a couple quid for the dining room, another couple quid for the bathroom which absolutely must be maintained or you'll end up with a serious mould problem in no time. Then assuming you have no gas add to that the cost of heating water using electricity, too.

If you're lodging and have to just top up one room, sure, whatever, it doesn't seem like a lot.

586,"I have a lodger so I'm sort of a live-in landlord in that respect. Since the start I've made it absolutely clear that she can use the central heating whenever she needs to. All the TRVs are on 50%, so if she wants it warmer and I want it cooler we can leave the thermostat alone and just achieve it on the TRVs. 

She's well aware that if the bills become problematic (as in, I'm losing money because the cost of having her here is higher than what she pays) then the rent will go up to cover them. This is her incentive not to take the piss.

That's all there needs to be to it. If your LL isn't prepared to operate such a system and treat you like a grown up, then to be honest they're just a shitty person and you'd do well to find somewhere better to live.

Anyway basically gas is cheaper than electric so if you've got GCH then you're better off using that and controlling the temperature in each room from the radiator, than bringing electric heaters into the melee which probably won't add any benefit, will cost more to run, and have a much higher chance of burning your house down.",2024-01-22 02:29:45,1,london,comment,Moved into a loft room for 3 months… live in landlady doesn’t put heating on very often

667,"""The gradual, but persistent death of the London living room"". This isn't new at all, it's been that way for some time now.

When I first moved to London, I lived in a two-bedroom house, but the downstairs living room had been turned into a third bedroom. The landlord got the house with Right to Buy, so the house was supposed to have a family living in it, but he rented it out instead. I didn't pay by direct debit; I used to leave my money in cash in the microwave, and he'd come late at night to pick it up.

One day he found out that someone from the Right to Buy scheme was coming to check the house, so he needed to make it look like a family was living there. He turned up in the morning, rehung all of the doors so they didn't have locks on, moved all of the furniture out of the downstairs bedroom, put living room furniture in, and then at the end of the day after the inspection happened, returned everything to normal. 

So I guess you could say that we did have a living room for about six hours for one day when he thought his scam was going to be rumbled.",2020-04-23 09:06:58,633,london,comment,The sudden death of the London living room; “About half of all listings on SpareRoom in the capital have no lounge”

676,"What's really frustrating is that, as someone who had similar experiences, when we moved out of the country for a few years we decided to be the BEST landlords ever and instead got absolutely SHAT on by money-grabbing lettings management companies. 

We let out place out for two years and when we got it back, had to literally gut it back to studs and joists it was so ruined,. We had completely renovated it for tenants. So upsetting. 

The management companies would get complaints from tenants and not pass them on or do anything about it. We would have been very happy to fix leaks and other issues but weren't told about them until it was too late. Our tenants were told we said no to fixes, which was never true, so they thought we were total pricks and didn't care about our property as a result. Such a stupid situation.

Lettings management companies are an enormous part of the problem in London renting. They get their fees from landlords AND the tenants upfront, and then don't have to actually manage the property adequately - as long as they're 'sorting it' on paper they can just keep putting off arranging contractors etc for anything indefinitely for anything that's not 'roof fallen in' levels of complaint. 

Even good landlords can be caught by that, we never wanted our tenants to have to live in a shitty leaky space but that ended up being out of our hands. We would never let a property again unless we could be there to look after the tenants ourselves.

Anyway one day our landlord randomly turned up and kicked off there were three people living there.

Complete joke. They did nothing. They said I needed some sort of certificate for water safety, I told them to just get it sorted.

Good landlords do exist, we just need to get rid of the crooked ones...which is not an easy task.

I even created a web platform for flat and room ratings where tenants can share their previous tenancy experience and help each other to not make the same mistakes. To make people more aware of the room price, it's condition, ongoing issues, area info, etc. We can't rate landlords yet, but we have to start from somewhere and this is just the beginning.

You could put it there, so we can grow the community and finally make a difference and change how tenants are being treated; starting from London.

759,"I think as the rental market falls post Coronavirus and post brexit. Tenants will demand more from properties, like having a living area, having a kitchen table, having a bedroom that meets the 7m2 legal minimum requirements for a multi occupancy household. 

If that means property owners return the living room into a living room instead of a bedroom then that's what will happen. 

You could try to cram 6 people into a 4 bed house, with one in the garage and one in the living room. Charging £500 a month for each room. Or you could fit 4 people into a 4 bed house with a living room, decent kitchen and garage to store bikes ect, and charge £750 per room. 

Same money, less liability, and less rooms you have to fill. It makes sense. 

The reason they don't do it now, it haven't done it in the past, is because demand for housing meant that they could stuff as many people as they could into a house and still charge £750 per room. But as demand falls, wages tumble, unemployment rises and migrants head home, hopefully people demand more from their landlords.

795,"Yeah, it’s common enough. Logic is the common thread there really, both systems are very much about constructing strict frameworks by which to process and understand discrete propositions (such as numbers in maths, or premises in logic).

Arithmetic is largely underpinned by logic (though to what extent is a matter of some debate), and so the idea is that a lot of mathematical objects and operations can essentially be boiled right down into purely logical terms. Some philosophers (Frege) have tried to prove that maths is pretty much entirely reducable to logic, while others (Hilbert, Brouwer) have taken a more abstract, intuitive approach.

It’s a really interesting field of study, mostly because maths isn’t really something people tend to question in their day-to-day. People may ponder scientific questions like “why is the sky blue?” but it’s less common for someone to ask “why does 2 + 2 always equal 4?” and there are interesting and surprising answers to these kinds of questions!",2020-04-23 23:05:52,5,london,comment,The sudden death of the London living room; “About half of all listings on SpareRoom in the capital have no lounge”

- Convert the terraced houses right next to the station into mixed use apartment blocks with affordable housing, luxury housing, and amenities.

The result is much more affordable housing, and you don't have a system of inheritance which push house prices up across generation after generation which cuts out even any chance of people in London to get a foothold on the ladder without having come from money.

A house being worth ""nothing"" 40 years later isn't entirely true. You are buying the land, and the house on it is effectively your personal property. Japanese culture makes it normal to want to live in a place that hasn't been lived in before. That's nothing to do with government migration policy and everything to do with societal norms and preferences. The value of the land is still dictated by its location.

It's the same as buying a parking space, and putting a car on it. The car depreciates in value, the land it's on doesn't, and you can choose how expensive the car you buy is.

In equivalence that means you can buy cheap second hand (e.g. live in the second hand house), or you can go right up to new luxury. It's not uncommon for a new luxury item today to be near worthless 15 years later (cars, Apple products etc.).

1053,"A building might get rebuilt once every 40 or 50 years. Your average home in the UK would be gutted and re-done at least once in that period, if not twice. Japanese houses are typically built using cheap and lightweight eco-friendly materials (lots of wood, bamboo etc), in fact really no more material than a proper refurb in the UK might use. And that's not to say they don't destroy the framework every time either. The old materials are easily recycled, adding further value to the enterprise.

It's also healthy for the economy, it keeps money flowing, people in work, and is the reason Japan has the most amount of architects per capita of any country in the world - a high value profession.

In other words, buildings aren't sat there unproductively storing up people's money until they're completely out of reach, they're actually contributing to a fair and balanced economy.",2023-01-27 15:25:28,5,london,comment,Living rooms are becoming a luxury

I was calling this stuff out in 2010 when Cameron got in. I was typically downvoted on Reddit, told that I'm too partisan, too extreme, too *hateful* against Tories, the poor Tories.

I'm actually pretty moderate centre-left and always have been. I'm not into ""destroy capitalism"" or anything like that. But I could see very easily from 2010 that the Tory austerity was ideological, it was economically illiterate, and it was going to seriously downgrade our country. And I saw that their zealous deregulation and anti-welfare crusades was going to have huge ramifications, greatly subtract from people's sense of security, and would probably end up socially murdering tens of thousands of people through knock-on effects.

This was all pretty obvious at the time, if you didn't have a stick up your arse.

Corbyn got it right. How many of you were ""very sophisticated centrist liberals""  who undermined him? Many of you need to get real: you're not American capitalists, you're just white collar office workers in England. Your country, it turns out, had relied on the plank of post-war Labour's social welfarism. Without that we are nothing; we look almost feudal.

Quit deluding yourselves. The international super-rich, and American investors in particular, will utterly eat you for breakfast, buy you and sell you.

1118,"Markets exist whether you like it or not. It's not an engineered thing.

Even in places where markets are outlawed, black markets and gray markets exist. 

A property with X amount of space in it, and X number of rooms is wanted by people. There is an amount of effort/sacrifice people will be willing to do to have that property. That translates to a market price. If you legislate against it, that demand doesn't go away, it just manifests in other ways - e.g. a waiting list that only the affluent can get on, or a black market system that trades slots through bribery, or something else.

And the solution doesn't have to be a free-market solution. If the government built a million homes outside the market, that would make homes way cheaper. If the government improve pubic transport massively, then people could live further away from the things that they want get to, and we'd have more space. If we deregulated some of the zoning in London, more homes could be built.

What's wrong about the idea is the thought that you can legislate away a supply problem. 

It's functionally not different than telling 3 people sharing a 3 bedroom flat with no living room that they have to kick someone out, and the remaining two need to split the rent between themselves. Of *course*, they would prefer to have the extra living space, but they choose not to because they can't afford it. Telling them it's illegal to live that way doesn't make it more affordable.

Nor does telling the landlord, because that's exactly what he'll do. He'll say ""Okay, fine, one of you is kicked out and one of these rooms is now a living room"". He has no incentive to lower the rent after doing so. The property is still the same size, and the demand for it is still the same. In fact, it's probably higher, because a huge percentage of the London population that was living without a living room has now gotten kicked out and is competing for the remaining properties.

You can make the supply and demand argument all you want, but ultimately a line has to be drawn somewhere as to how low we're willing to let living standards slip.

There are minimum regulations for what a home can be, and it's good that there are. But those do increase the prices of homes. It's necessarily related. 

If you could sell a death-trap legally, then it would be possible to buy that death trap home below the current market rates. Slums are slums, but they're also cheap.

It's good that we regulate against slums, without proper safety or various minimum requirements, because they have knock-on effects (e.g. lots of people dying in a fire).

But that does mean that things cost more. It's good, that people be forced to pay for fire-safe, healthy homes, because if they aren't forced to pay for that many people will buy unsafe homes and there will be a much larger future cost to that. People are very bad at judging future costs.

But is a living room something that's the minimum requirements? Outside space? Dining room? We have to draw the line somewhere.

My first place (out of uni) was a studio. I chose that because I didn't want to live with room mates. It didn't have a kitchen or a living room - and it was *waayyyy* cheaper than getting a place by myself with a kitchen and a living room. I'm glad that properties like that existed.

1162,"Again I think it varies by career and cost-of-living (NYC or LA would barely be a step up comparing wage vs rent I’m betting). I think the wedge of rich vs poor is getting hiked globally, and some poor areas of this country are surreal in how abysmal they are (still unsure if they fixed Flint, Michigan, but it was something out of a Dickens novel that should not have happened in the 21st century). 

I also don’t think the distinction between poor vs. unequal means much when they’re linked. Poverty and property tax have been tools to divide resources for ions, and it’s progressed. It’s why redlining was so important for racists in the 1940s and Black Americans still feel the effects of that today. When you have too much money, there’s no high in buying things anymore. The only thing left is exclusivity, and it’s been done to access to healthy food/exercise, safe neighborhoods/streets, boutique items or local made specialty places, things that are made well, leisure time and activities, etc. etc. They won’t stop doing it until they’re properly red taped — We’d still be working industrial revolution 14 hour days/6 day weeks in menial body breaking jobs had people not gone on strike and demanded it was put into law. 

They ran an article yesterday in the New York Times about how wealthy overweight women are making Ozempic and other diabetes/obesity drugs harder to get because they’re using them as diet pills. Poor people put on pounds because healthy food items poor people have relied on have hiked in price (because of foodie obsession or just inflation) and streets have been cut up/been more polluted with cars, and they work longer harder hours and accumulate more stress (cortisol has been linked with weight gain). And instead of fix any of that, they’d rather just fix the rich people who receive friendly fire. Now they treat these chubby rich people with “miracle drugs”, and then fill their gaunt faces with filler (or other body fat that didn’t come off) when they inevitably deflate. I didn’t mean to go off sequitur as much but the sheer vanity of it gagged me.

Prices are determined by the amount of supply compared to the demand. 

If living rooms are being converted into bedrooms, then the total number of bedrooms available is higher.

Going the other way, if it's illegal to rent out properties without a living room, then bedrooms will have to be converted and tenants will have to be evicted. And the total number of available bedrooms will be lower to the same number of people. 

Yeah the people who can afford properties will have a living room, but anyone who was living in a studio, or a was the 3rd person in 3-bedroom flat share with no living room will be shit out of luck, and will need to compete for the now more-limited number of rooms.

Imagine you're an (evil) landlord renting to 3 people in a place with no living room. You're gonna legally have to kick someone out. If no one wants to move, now you've got a bidding war between the the 3 people, and the per-room cost will go up for the tenants, and it will be a lot because no one can be the person without a place.

1233,"It’s a fair point, but it’s ultimately it’s not the landlords who are making these decisions. There are plenty of places to rent that have living rooms. They’re just extremely expensive.

Similarly, there are also lots of studio flats where there is no separate kitchen. And they are much cheaper than places with a separate living room.

If you want to have a separate living room, nothing stops you from paying more, except lack of money.

If we outlaw studios, the price of places with separate living rooms doesn’t go down. In fact they become more expensive, since there will be people who otherwise would choose to live in smaller accommodation, who lose the option and now fork out the extra money (somehow) for the living room, and everyone will be competing.

So the choices are let people have the option of no living room, and have lower rental prices. Or force them to pay more for a now more expensive living room.

I realise this is the same argument for say, a bathroom or fire safety. And yes, for those things I do think we should force people to pay more. I don’t think people should have the option to risk their health and lives, because I think that cost ends up being paid for elsewhere (E.g. NHS).

Perhaps you think that the mental health toll of not having a living room is similarly damaging. I possibly could be convinced of that, I totally agree that mental health is important.

But just recognise that the choice to pass such a law would be a deliberate choice to raise rents, so the benefit to the general public needs to be weighed against that reality.

Just passing a law like that and hoping it won’t have any side effects is up there with the war on drugs in terms of bad ideas.",2023-01-27 20:24:57,-1,london,comment,Living rooms are becoming a luxury

1248,"Indeed, and the politicians won't stop adding people to the population endlessly at rates far faster than we can even hope to build for.

It's insanity, and all about pumping up all their numbers, to our very serious and real detriment.

We need to be more like Japan, in many ways, where you can still get a property in a commutable suburb of Tokyo for circa £150k, and a place to live entirely free in rural areas due to the naturally declining population. We would be in a similar position to Japan and the way things were in the 90s if our government focused on economic growth via education and industry instead of just pumping the numbers to increase job and housing market competition over the last 25 years.

Edit: why is this being downvoted so much? Is it because people don't like the truth? It's a very simple case of supply and demand. Demand is far higher than we can supply for.

1283,"I'm also 35, and still renting with friends. I get along well with them so it's generally been a positive to be living with friends, and it's not been until the last couple of years that I could have really afforded a place on my own.

I am at the point now where I am getting tired of having so little space, would like somewhere bigger to myself, and could afford it. But I'm also now at the point where I can almost afford to buy somewhere, so I'll likely just aim for that. It doesn't seem worth the extra hassle to move to another rental place on my own where I'll be paying twice the rent, when my current living situation is relatively stable, and the landlord hasn't increased the rent for years.

With rents as expensive as they are, the crossover between being able to afford renting a (half decent) place on your own, and affording to buy seems pretty small - not to mention when you are renting on your own, your ability to save towards buying a house will take a big hit. It all depends on your situation and priorities though, I guess. If I didn't have the opportunity to live with friends that I've known for 10 years, I would have definitely prioritised renting somewhere on my own sooner, as I've not enjoyed sharing with people I don't know in the past.

As for your last point, I doubt you'll have much trouble finding landlords that are willing to have older people living in their house. Our landlord seemed particularly happy to have some slightly older working people renting her house, compared to students or younger people, since we're more likely to pay our rent on time and not cause problems. She does seem an exception to the rule though, just owns and rents out one house since moving away, and manages it directly, rather than through an agency. I guess there are a section that are generally against professional sharers for whatever reason, and prefer couples/families, and then there's a section that are specifically geared towards students. Renting a room in a shared house where your much older than the others may be problematic, though probably at least as much for you as it is for the other tenants.

Ultimately London is, unfortunately, a very expensive place to live. It does seem like the majority of people who stick around are either younger people who are happy to share and saving up for something bigger, or have ""made it"" and earn well enough to be able to buy. Not to mention it's obviously easier to afford something bigger if you're in a relationship with someone and splitting the cost. It's definitely rough for those in between, but in the end I guess you have to make a choice between if living in London is important enough vs being able to afford a bigger place - it's likely to be cheaper and easier in other cities, or at least further out in the suburbs.",2023-04-20 15:59:21,12,london,comment,"Anyone here in their 30s, 40s, 50s (and possibly beyond!) still only renting a room in a shared flat or house?"

1382,"I agree with you that it really depends. For me the best scenario is sharing with friends you know REALLY well and the ideal is sharing with your partner.

In most cases you don't know the people you're going to share a flat if you're not renting a whole flat/house from the start.

It's not high-flying careers that give you the 'luxury' of living on your own. It's the role itself, the specialism and the company. You can find different salaries for the same role in different companies. It's a matter of luck, industry and experience.

Now that more companies are open to the idea of remote working (not all sadly) it is possible to find a place of your own (studio for example) outside London and in a small town but it also means you will not have the social life of London (if you have one in London). It really is a personal matter.

I know people who could afford living on their own but they preferred sharing with others because they did not want to live alone and they liked meeting other people.

Looking at the rents for 1-bed flats in London is really painful. For a decent place you have to give a fortune, plus bills, regardless of the zone! Then it makes sense buying a place of your own but interest rates are very high and there are no signs of better days.

1460,"I'm also 35, and still renting with friends. I get along well with them so it's generally been a positive to be living with friends, and it's not been until the last couple of years that I could have really afforded a place on my own.

I am at the point now where I am getting tired of having so little space, would like somewhere bigger to myself, and could afford it. But I'm also now at the point where I can almost afford to buy somewhere, so I'll likely just aim for that. It doesn't seem worth the extra hassle to move to another rental place on my own where I'll be paying twice the rent, when my current living situation is relatively stable, and the landlord hasn't increased the rent for years.

With rents as expensive as they are, the crossover between being able to afford renting a (half decent) place on your own, and affording to buy seems pretty small - not to mention when you are renting on your own, your ability to save towards buying a house will take a big hit. It all depends on your situation and priorities though, I guess. If I didn't have the opportunity to live with friends that I've known for 10 years, I would have definitely prioritised renting somewhere on my own sooner, as I've not enjoyed sharing with people I don't know in the past.

As for your last point, I doubt you'll have much trouble finding landlords that are willing to have older people living in their house. Our landlord seemed particularly happy to have some slightly older working people renting her house, compared to students or younger people, since we're more likely to pay our rent on time and not cause problems. She does seem an exception to the rule though, just owns and rents out one house since moving away, and manages it directly, rather than through an agency. I guess there are a section that are generally against professional sharers for whatever reason, and prefer couples/families, and then there's a section that are specifically geared towards students. Renting a room in a shared house where your much older than the others may be problematic, though probably at least as much for you as it is for the other tenants.

Ultimately London is, unfortunately, a very expensive place to live. It does seem like the majority of people who stick around are either younger people who are happy to share and saving up for something bigger, or have ""made it"" and earn well enough to be able to buy. Not to mention it's obviously easier to afford something bigger if you're in a relationship with someone and splitting the cost. It's definitely rough for those in between, but in the end I guess you have to make a choice between if living in London is important enough vs being able to afford a bigger place - it's likely to be cheaper and easier in other cities, or at least further out in the suburbs.",2023-04-20 15:59:21,12,london,comment,"Anyone here in their 30s, 40s, 50s (and possibly beyond!) still only renting a room in a shared flat or house?"

1559,"I agree with you that it really depends. For me the best scenario is sharing with friends you know REALLY well and the ideal is sharing with your partner.

In most cases you don't know the people you're going to share a flat if you're not renting a whole flat/house from the start.

It's not high-flying careers that give you the 'luxury' of living on your own. It's the role itself, the specialism and the company. You can find different salaries for the same role in different companies. It's a matter of luck, industry and experience.

Now that more companies are open to the idea of remote working (not all sadly) it is possible to find a place of your own (studio for example) outside London and in a small town but it also means you will not have the social life of London (if you have one in London). It really is a personal matter.

I know people who could afford living on their own but they preferred sharing with others because they did not want to live alone and they liked meeting other people.

Looking at the rents for 1-bed flats in London is really painful. For a decent place you have to give a fortune, plus bills, regardless of the zone! Then it makes sense buying a place of your own but interest rates are very high and there are no signs of better days.

1647,"I guess this is just a bit of a rant to share my frustration about the state of the room rental market in London. I'm having to move and just started searching for rooms and I forgot just how shocking and demeaning the whole process is. I've seen a couple of places and what was on offer was just pure squalor, bathtubs rusting, tatty furniture - the thing is you can't see the reality of it all in the photos, you have to see it for yourself in person.

I feel like a piece of meat, like a cash cow, no dignity to be had here. I call the phone numbers on Spare Room, Facebook, Zoopla, mostly no answer, I leave a voicemail, never get a callback, my messages echo in a black hole, as no replies are to be seen, agents' number one line that they simply have to say to you 'Let me know ASAP because the room is gonna go instantly'. And the scams! Oh the scams! Ads that show compilations of spacious rooms from a variety of houses offering a promise of reasonable rent only to reel you in - Sorry that's not available! But we have 10 other (more expensive) rooms.

I'm being shown around properties by what looks like a 17-year-old boy. Agents 45 min late, not bothering to let me know or apologise, while I wait outside the property in the middle of my workday. One thing I learned the hard way - don't mention you work from home, because you might be a more undesirable tenant - being discriminated against because you work from home is a brand new area to navigate.

Did I mention 'agents' who can't write a full, grammatically correct sentence?

I think this is just the beginning of things I will see this time around. The things I have seen in London I have never ever seen in any of the other 4 European countries I lived in. It really makes me question sometimes why I even bother being here.

1826,"I have recently moved in to a rented flat. Been here for over 2 months now. It is all good overall. The process of finding it though bit so much.

We had been to aroun 20 viewings in June with my girlfriend and 17 of the 20 flats we've seen looked like the pictures of them had been taken a good 10yrs prior. Most of them had holes in the walls, smelled awful, a few of them had single mattresses littered all over the floors (Romanians most likely), were terribly dirty to the point that we would spent a good few months just to clean it.

The best part of it all? Agencies as well as the landlords don't seem to see the issue with trying to rent something in such a terrible state to someone.
Heck, even we were forced to re-paint all of the rooms ourselves because landlord said he won't do it, and the walls looked terrible.

You need to literally go through hell nowadays to find something to rent in London that doesn't look like it had been chewed up, eaten and vomited out by a troll.

Not mentioning that our contract stated that for the duration of the tenancy we agree not to change our jobs? Can you believe that crap? They thought we won't read it or something I guess, but we pointed out that it's just ridiculous and they removed it. 

Long story short, me and my girlfriend came to the same conclusion after renting rooms for the past few years before we moved in together for the 1st time last year: 
We rather spend more on the bills and rent and have less money to put aside than having to deal with most often than not nasty/disgusting roommates and finally have some freedom in the place we live in.",2021-09-22 15:38:34,1,london,comment,London room rental / flatshare market UGHHHH

It seems like every flat share that I look at seems to have a bunch of people that want to socialise.

If I had the financial ability I would rent alone but I do want to save my money not spend it on rent just yet or a home. And in London unfortunately THE ONLY AFFORDABLE way to live alone between 600-1000, where you want to live is through sharing. 

Personally I look at moving out to get independence and have a HOME to relax in not socialise. I work so hard and need my rest. 

Obviously I could rest but then it will come across rude and that's what I don't want. I am not good at socialising. I like watching my own TV shows in my room or lounge, not talking unless required. I can small talk but I feel like it is so much effort to sacrifice things I like to speak and socialise with house mates. Also I get nervous. I get nervous doing things I'm forced/not comfortable doing and then I get quiet, even though I don't mean to. Previously when I house shared for many years I would be really upset teary and depressed knowing everytime I left my room I would have to face people and talk. Not in a bad way to the people but I feel like I should just be able to relax and do my thing without so much effort 😔 

It seems like in London all the flat share are my aged people who want to make friends, do things together, eat together, everything. And I can't find a way to find a home or flat share to filter this out. It's quiet sad because all the homes in my price range have flat mates who want a friend rather than a tenant 😔 obviously I don't mind friends but I can't have friends 24 7 I just like my space. 

In other countries it is respected and common to have some privacy but in London that's not the case. I'm not an expat",2022-08-27 18:59:39,115,london,submission,Why are London flat shares so socially driven!? How to find social anxiety-friendly flat shares ?

One thing worth exploring would be families looking for a lodger. Seems like there's way less expectation that you're expected to socialise in that situation compared to a flatshare of people in their 20s/30s.

You can sometimes get private use of a bathroom too. A lot of people now have two bedroom, two bathroom apartments.

When I was looking for house shares, everyone seemed to want to find “a proper friend up for cooking dinner together, hanging out and exploring the city” (or some variation of). Which is all well and good but 1) I’m usually too tired after work 2) I knew I was going to spend most weekends 150miles away to spend time with my partner.

I was honest about point 2 - I didn’t get many responses.

My point is that you're unlikely to find an advert seeking someone who keeps to themselves. If you read the adverts you can get the idea of what it's like though.

If they're social but understand people need their space, probably not for you.

If they're quiet but don't mind a glass of wine together, that probably won't happen all that often and might be more suitable for you.

If you can't be bothered with that, places where socialising is physically difficult is the way to go.

What should I look for in the contract to see whether it binds all the housemates together? 

It seems like a lot on spare room is from flat mates rather than landlords this makes me worried as I don't trust anyone else other than me and the landlord exchange contracts. 

I think if it was the house mates then it makes sense why they come across so needy, specific, and temperamental in their posts 

I lived in accommodation that had a tiny open plan living room and I found that I made so many friends because there wasn't pressure to socialise. We would go out every few weekends, sometimes they would cook for me or watch movies with me and it was nice because we all respected each other space we weren't attached and it wasn't offensive if we left to be in our room! That's my perfect situation but I haven't got it in me to go through that social aspect again.

The flat does not have sufficient space/amenities for 4 people (single washing machine, single fridge/freezer, etc.) and I would not have signed a contract had I know this was an option.

With all the people looking to rent in London why couldn't they have just let us stay as a 3 person house? Our old flatmate is still paying bills until his contract ends in May so they had plenty of time to find someone but they've got the new couple moving in next week!

1955,"The landlord of my current place put up an advert stating that he wanted someone to make this their home and who would socialise with the other flatmates. I met two of them who seemed fairly quiet but nice (hadn't met the other two).    I live with four people, everyone eats in their room (despite having a dining room with a table) and most people wear headphones when they enter the kitchen. It's not uncommon to go four days without even a 'hey, how are you?'.  The only real communication is the house whatsapp group which is really a passive aggressive complaints bulletin board.

I might be moving because one of the two I hadn't met is the housemate from hell and the landlord is very sympathetic. However, I don't know whether to hope that my next house share will be more sociable than this. I've had friends say their work colleagues describe their experience of moving in with randoms in London as very similar to mine (minus the housemate from hell).  Perhaps I am more extroverted than most people and people more introverted than myself feel drained after a day of making small talk in the office don't want to bother with that when they get home.   However, I subletted whilst I flathunted though and my temporary flatmate was very sociable (we generally ate meals together - he even cooked for me for a couple of times and we  did something sociable together out the house about once a week).

TLDR:  Can moving in with randoms in London ever lead to a social house or do people tend to just eat in their rooms and not talk?
